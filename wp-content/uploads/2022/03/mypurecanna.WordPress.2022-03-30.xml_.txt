		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With weed edibles for sale across Canada, the public can now benefit from this convenient form of consumption. The benefits of edibles are well-documented, but what are the side effects that some experience with edible ingestion?
<h2>Common Side Effects of Weed Edibles</h2>
Most people can consume cannabis without experiencing any adverse side effects. But for some individuals, it’s not always plain sailing. Between a dry mouth, anxiety, paranoia, and the more intense high associated with edible ingestion, edibles can sometimes become unpleasant for some.

It’s often due to a low tolerance coupled with an excessive dose, but in some instances, people are simply more susceptible to the side effects of edibles when compared to smoked or vaped forms of cannabis.
<h2>Weed Hangovers</h2>
One of the most common side effects of edibles is the hangover. It’s similar to a standard weed hangover but is often more intense due to the nature of edibles. They’re a much more potent source of THC, and when we consume too much too late, we’re more likely to feel groggy the next morning.

Edibles are much longer-lasting than smoked or vaped forms of cannabis. With more intense effects lasting upwards of eight hours or more, this heightens the risk of a hangover when we consume too much.

The scientific data on weed hangovers isn’t conclusive. Some studies suggest it’s a thing, while others suggest that the groggy symptoms may be due to something else. Regardless, anecdotal evidence suggests that with increased edible doses, people sometimes tend to rise with mental fog and fatigue upon waking up.
<h2>Cottonmouth after Consuming Weed Edibles</h2>
Cottonmouth is a common side effect of cannabis consumption and is particularly common with edibles. Contrary to popular belief, dehydration isn’t the reason behind this. THC binds to our salivary glands and prevents the production of saliva after ingestion.

These symptoms can also spread to the eyes where increased reddening appears as the tear glands stop working optimally. With limited function, it leads to a decreased blink rate, which only serves to accentuate the problem.

As is usually the case, the larger the dose, the more serious the symptoms. Although they never become dangerous, they’re certainly inconvenient to experience.
<h2>Anxiety and Paranoia With Marijuana Edibles</h2>
Anxiety and paranoia are two common side effects among patients who either consume far too high a dose or have underlying issues that a cannabis edible merely brings to the surface. Such side effects are much more likely with high-THC consumption and a lack of CBD to balance out the effects.

While it can be a frightening and disorientating experience, such side effects are likely to be transitory and will usually pass within a few hours. The intensity of any anxiety or paranoia often relates to dose size. The higher the dose, the more likely you are to experience such negative side-effects.

If you’re inexperienced with edible consumption, start with a low dose and gradually work up to a functional dose. 10 mg represents a standard edible dose, but it’s not uncommon for this to be too much for beginners who are more susceptible to anxiety or paranoia. 2.5mg of THC is a good starting dose for those who prefer to dip their feet into the water slowly.
<h2>Edibles Provide A Longer-lasting and More Intense High</h2>
By and large, edibles are much more potent than smoked or vaped forms of cannabis. The onset time is more prolonged, but once they kick in, the effects often ramp up and stay elevated for several hours.

The danger associated with edible consumption is that patients redose before the first dose has taken effect. Depending on your metabolism and how much food is in your stomach at the time of ingestion, it can take up to two hours for an edible to take effect. If you’re starting out, make sure you get to know your own body by allowing for full absorption before redosing. The last thing you’ll want is to redose only for the effects to finally hit an hour later. Remember, you can always eat more, but there’s not much you can do if the effects come on too strong.

The reason for the increased potency of edibles is in how the body processes THC. The THC present in edibles converts in the liver to the more potent form known as 11-Hydroxy-THC. This form of THC interacts very differently within the body and produces more intense effects that last a lot longer than the Delta 9 THC present in smoked or vaped forms of cannabis.
<h2>Hallucinations With Marijuana Edibles</h2>
Hallucinations are more commonly associated with psychedelics. But when ingested in sufficiently high quantities, hallucinations can be a common side-effect of edible forms of cannabis.

In his book, Confessions of a Hasheesh Eater, Fitz Hugh Ludlow describes using hashish to induce altered states of consciousness to explore more deeply the nature of the unconscious mind. While this may have merit, very few cannabis consumers are looking for such profound experiences.

High-dose edibles and a sufficiently low tolerance are likely to induce hallucinations that could become frightening and overwhelming.
<h2>Cannabis Edibles and Lethargy</h2>
Some people report bouts of lethargy after the effects of an edible wear off. Such side effects are unwelcome if you have to work or otherwise maintain focus and concentration. If you find you’re susceptible to lethargy after consuming an edible, then it’s best to wait until evening or weekends before consuming them.
<h2>Weed Edibles for Sale in Canada</h2>
At Pure Canna, we’ve got an extensive stock of weed edibles for sale. With CBD and THC varieties, they come in a range of delicious flavors in doses ranging from 10mg to 20mg and come in both Indica and Sativa varieties.

While the side effects mentioned above can occur, the truth is that with responsible consumption, there’s very little that can go wrong. Ensure you start out with a lower dose and feel free to bring some CBD into the mix should any anxiety symptoms begin to appear. CBD tends to counteract THC’s psychoactive effects and can help you navigate a negative experience much more effectively.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The first recorded use of medicinal cannabis occurred in 2700 BC in ancient China. It was initially used to combat conditions like rheumatism, gout, malaria, and even absent-mindedness. As it spread across the globe, its range of medicinal benefits increased in kind. The availability of <a href="https://lowpricebud.co/">medical marijuana</a> in Canada means that we can now avail of a host of benefits that few other forms of medications can match. Here are some of the principal benefits of cannabis in treating several well-known conditions.
<h2>Medical Marijuana as a Treatment for Arthritis</h2>
Arthritis is one of those conditions that responds very well to cannabis treatment. The secret lies in the ability of cannabis to manage pain symptoms, something that those afflicted with severe forms of arthritis find particularly debilitating.

In addition to quelling pain, the CBD present in medical marijuana can also help reduce inflammation and promote sleep. With its multifaceted mechanisms of action, many patients find cannabis to be an essential ally in treating the symptoms of this debilitating condition.
<h2>Glaucoma Treatment With Medical Marijuana</h2>
Glaucoma is a condition that increases pressure in the eyeball and poses a danger to the delicate optic nerve. In severe cases, it can even cause a loss of vision. Studies carried out in the 1970s showed that cannabis can help lower the intraocular pressure in those afflicted with the condition. In certain severe cases, this may prevent inevitable blindness.
<h2>Cannabis For Seizure Control</h2>
Cannabis is highly effective in suppressing seizures and is often much more effective than pharmaceutical interventions. One of the most well-known cases of using marijuana to control seizures was with Charlotte Figi, a young American girl who suffered from a severe form of epilepsy. Charlotte experienced up to 300 epileptic seizures per month before medicating with cannabis. After administering a high CBD strain that became known as Charlotte’s Web, her seizures reduced to one per month.
<h2>How Medical Marijuana Helps Treat Crohn’s Disease</h2>
Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease that leads to symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, weight loss, diarrhea, and anemia, among others.

While cannabis doesn’t cure Chron’s disease outright, several studies suggest that it can reduce the symptoms and enhance the quality of life of patients. The primary mechanism of action of cannabis as it relates to Crohn’s is its anti-inflammatory properties. Its ability to quell inflammation works synergistically with its ability to diminish pain and increase appetite, three factors that serve to enhance the life of anyone afflicted with Crohn’s disease.
<h2>Using Medical Cannabis to Treat Anxiety</h2>
Anxiety is a complex condition, the roots of which often run deep in those affected. Cannabis tends to impart an increased sense of calm, improved relaxation, and better sleep. When it comes to treating anxiety with cannabis, the choice of strain is of particular importance. Scientific and anecdotal evidence suggest that CBD is helpful, and many patients choose strains with a 1:1 ratio of CBD to THC.

While the evidence suggests benefits to using cannabis as a treatment for anxiety, strains that are too high in THC with little to no CBD may amplify any underlying anxiety and worsen symptoms.
<h2>Cannabis As an Appetite Stimulant</h2>
For patients undergoing intense bouts of chemotherapy, one of the common side-effects is reduced appetite and increased nausea. When already weak patients can’t nourish themselves with wholesome food, it places additional strain on the recovery process.

THC is particularly useful in working as an appetite stimulant while also decreasing pain and nausea. Cannabis is widely prescribed to chemo patients and undoubtedly helps promote the healing process by enhancing appetite among recovering patients.
<h2>Cannabis and PTSD</h2>
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder caused by prior experience with traumatic events. It’s particularly common among veterans returning from war zones, and those afflicted often re-experience the traumatizing events in vivid detail, something that provokes an intense bodily stress response.

Research suggests that those afflicted with PTSD have low levels of anandamide, an endogenous cannabinoid produced within the body with a remarkably similar structure to THC. When THC is administered, the subsequent binding with the CB1 receptors deactivates the traumatic memories among patients. When consumed in conjunction with CBD, its anti-anxiety and calming effects complement the THC, placing patients in a calm state, and liberating them temporarily from the debilitating symptoms of PTSD.
<h2>How Medical Marijuana Helps with ADHD/ADD</h2>
Those who have ADHD and ADD often have trouble focusing on the task at hand. Cannabis can be particularly effective at helping people maintain focus and productivity.

ADHD and ADD are closely related to a dopamine deficit in the brain. Medications like Adderall and Ritalin stimulate dopamine and promote concentrations. But these gains often come with a host of unpleasant side effects and withdrawal symptoms.

For its part, cannabis seems to interact with the brain’s dopamine production and increases its availability. Cannabis also appears to induce a mental slowdown that prevents patients from becoming overwhelmed by sensory input. Strain choice is very much personal preference when it comes to treating ADHD and ADD. Some report success with high THC strains, while others need to balance out the effects of THC with some CBD.
<h2>Pain Reduction in Multiple Sclerosis</h2>
Many of those afflicted with multiple sclerosis find medical marijuana hugely beneficial in controlling the pain symptoms. Research demonstrates the pain-relieving properties of THC, and when it comes to multiple sclerosis, it can help alleviate the pain associated with painful muscle contractions.
<h2>How Cannabis Reduces Tremors in Parkinson’s Patients</h2>
Parkinson’s disease is a chronic neurological disorder that deteriorates with time. There is no known cure for this disease, and patients often suffer from uncontrollable tremors, pain, and difficulty sleeping. Studies show that medical cannabis plays an important role in protecting against the neurodegeneration commonly observed with Parkinson’s disease. Cannabis also seems to help improve motor skills among patients and reduce the uncontrollable tremors that many experience.
<h2>Medical Marijuana in Canada</h2>
At Pure Canna, we stock a wide range of cannabis products to treat the above conditions and many more. Between concentrates, edibles, tinctures, and cannabis flower, our extensive line of cannabis products are sure to fit your preferred method of administration.

Cannabis contains hundreds of compounds, each of which acts synergistically with other plant compounds to produce wide-ranging effects. Science is slowly coming to understand and explain the various mechanisms of action of cannabis. And as scientists slowly uncover the workings of this miraculous plant, the future for medical marijuana in Canada seems bright.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For those who haven’t heard, cannabidiol (CBD) is a compound found in cannabis that doesn’t get you high. Unlike it’s better-known cousin cannabinoid THC, this newly popular compound delivers medicinal relief without intoxication.

CBD makes cannabis-based medicines easier and more useful for daily relief. But what is this revolutionary cannabinoid used for? CBD has massive potential to reduce <a href="http://theweedlovers.com/can-cbd-gummies-help-with-my-anxiety-and-depression/">anxiety</a> and calm panic attacks (among many other applications).

Although the study of CBD for panic attacks and anxiety is ongoing, the preliminary evidence is strong and extremely convincing. Especially when combined with the sheer number of people who report positive results for their own anxiety, there has to be something to these anti-anxiety reports.
<h2>What is Anxiety, Panic, and Panic Attacks?</h2>
People often conflate stress with anxiety, but while former is a universal human experience, anxiety is a chronic mental health condition. Anxiety may be a result of chronic stress, develop following trauma, come from a genetic basis, or for some, have no known cause. Anxiety impacts people on a profound level, across all areas of their life.

According to the ADAA, an organization that researches and provides resources for anxiety and depression, the symptoms of anxiety are as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>Nervousness</li>
 	<li>Irritability</li>
 	<li>A sensation of oncoming doom or panic</li>
 	<li>Increased heart rate</li>
 	<li>Hyperventilation and sweating</li>
 	<li>Fatigue</li>
 	<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
 	<li>Upset stomach and gastrointestinal issues</li>
</ul>
The most common form is called generalized anxiety disorder, which the ADAA defined as “persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things.” Furthermore, the ADAA says people with generalized anxiety ” may worry more than seems warranted about actual events or may expect the worst even when there is no apparent reason for concern.”

For some, generalized anxiety disorder is just the start. It may spin out into a condition known as panic disorder. When anxiety reaches a more elevated phase, it can develop into full-blown anxiety attacks, also known as panic attacks. People with panic disorder “experience spontaneous seemingly out-of-the-blue panic attacks and are very preoccupied with the fear of a recurring attack,” as per the ADAA.

Currently, the conventional approach to treating anxiety and panic disorders are pharmaceutical-based. That means SSRIs and benzodiazepines, both of which have serious side effects and may be addictive for some people. It’s why people are turning to a natural option — CBD for panic disorders.
<h2>The Scientific Evidence Behind CBD for Anxiety</h2>
Before we dive into CBD for panic disorders, let’s cover the basics of CBD for anxiety disorders. Surprisingly the anti-anxiety properties of CBD were only first discovered thanks to their relationship with THC. CBD works to counterbalance the strong psychoactive intoxication of THC. Essentially THC reduces the strength and duration of a high and calms associated anxiety and paranoia. Importantly, CBD is non-intoxicating, and we now know it’s anti-psychoactive as well and may be useful for the treatment of psychosis and schizophrenia.

A 2011 study from Brazil also reported the positive benefits of CBD for social anxiety. Social anxiety is the fear of social situations, which in this study was modeled based on simulated public speeches. Researchers gave the participants either CBD or a placebo, then asked them to give a speech. They rated their experiential anxiety as well as their heart rate, blood pressure, and more.

Based on the total assessment, people who took CBD had measurable lower levels of anxiety than those who didn’t. Even people who didn’t have social anxiety disorder felt calmer thanks to CBD in this experiment.

Since this study on CBD and social anxiety, there has been an intense continuation of research. According to the authors of one literature review, “We found that existing preclinical evidence strongly supports CBD as a treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder when administered acutely.”
<h2>The Science of CBD Oil for Panic Disorder</h2>
Here we begin to see CBD’s role for treating panic attacks. While less understood compared to CBD for anxiety disorders, there is still mounting evidence about CBD’s efficacy for panic disorder.

Most of the evidence comes from brain imaging done on patients with panic disorder. In one case, patients dosed with CBD had decreased activity in the area of the brain responsible for emotional activation. This meant they had a decreased fear-based response to images of fearful faces.

Other studies relying on brain scans have determined “that CBD can alter the activity of brain areas such as the medial and left temporal lobes, prefrontal cortex and insula, regions that were also found to be modified in [panic disorder] patient.” This means, in areas of the brain that are altered by panic disorder and elevated levels of anxiety, acute CBD administration seems to reduce their heightened activity.
<h2>Can CBD Oil Stop Panic Attacks?</h2>
As anyone who experiences panic attacks knows, it can be impossible to stop the onset of an anxiety attack once the wheels are in motion. Even traditional pharmaceuticals don’t always do the trick. Yes, CBD is good to reduce anxiety and the frequency of panic attacks, but don’t expect a magic pill to make one disappear a few minutes beforehand.

CBD will not stop a panic attack if taken as an acute treatment right before onset. But, CBD can offer a general reduction in anxiety, especially when taken daily. Over time, as your general sense of worry and anxiety lessens thanks to a daily CBD dose, the severity, and frequency of panic attacks will also lessen. CBD works best to reduce your baseline anxiety, not to prevent the onset a few minutes before.

Patients have fallen in love with this option for anxiety and panic because it offers a safe, nonsedative alternative to pharmaceuticals. As the above scientific review concluded, “CBD does not present psychoactive effects; it is safe and well-tolerated via the oral route (up to 1,500 mg/day). Moreover, because this compound does not induce dependence, tolerance and abstinence symptoms, it can be, in the future, a good alternative as a substitute for high potency benzodiazepines and antidepressant drugs.”
<h2>A Daily Dose of CBD for Panic and Anxiety</h2>
If you have anxiety and struggle with panic attacks on a routine basis, why not give CBD a try? If you experiment for a few weeks, you will likely experience a slow decrease in the daily simmer of anxious thoughts, and perhaps a reduction in panic attacks. If you can combine with healthy eating habits, exercise, and therapy, CBD works well in a holistic treatment plan for panic disorder.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Edibles offer cannabis consumers with a healthy alternative to smoked forms of cannabis. But is there any truth to the idea that edibles may be damaging to the liver? If you'd like to buy edibles online in Canada, then here we fill you in on the current science.
<h2>Do Edibles Damage Your Liver?</h2>
There are many different ways of consuming cannabis. By smoking, vaping or administering it sublingually, consumers bypass the digestive tract and hence the liver. The active compounds enter the bloodstream through a direct route meaning that you'll feel the effects quickly and with the same relative intensity.

When consuming edibles, the active compounds must pass through the digestive tract before then passing through the body's main detox organ, the liver. It's these processes carried out in the liver that lead to the notable effects commonly associated with edibles. But just what is it that occurs in the liver? And can marijuana edible consumption lead to liver damage?
<h3>The Link Between Cannabis and Liver Damage</h3>
In recent times, the link between cannabis and liver damage arose due to an article that appeared on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeadams/2019/06/18/marijuana-study-finds-cbd-can-cause-liver-damage/#49f754ab43ff" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, where researchers claimed that mice who received high doses of CBD showed signs of liver damage within 24 hours.

It led Martin Lee, the author of <em>Smoke Signals,</em> the well-known book on cannabis culture to label it a case of "scientific fraud." The reasons given by other cannabis researchers included: the small sample size of 6 mice and the dose they received of 2460 mg/kg of CBD (over 100 times the recommended dose of the CBD-isolate Epidiolex at 20 mg/kg).
<h4>The Evidence that Cannabis Protects The Liver</h4>
A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/liv.13696" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">study</a> published in Liver International investigated the <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/what-are-the-side-effects-of-edibles/">effects of cannabis</a> on the progressive stages of alcoholic liver disease. Researchers found that cannabis consumers "had significantly lower odds than non‐dependent users for developing liver disease." This led them to conclude that "cannabis use is associated with a reduced incidence of liver disease in alcoholics."

While the study didn't indicate how the subjects involved in the study ingested cannabis, the findings certainly don't raise any red flags concerning cannabis having a negative impact on liver health.
<h5>Where the Science Stands on Cannabis and Liver Health</h5>
Few studies currently exist on whether cannabis is dangerous to liver health, and even fewer exist on the effects of edibles.

There is currently no credible evidence to suggest that medicinal or recreational cannabis is harmful to liver health. The lack of any credible evidence is what leads almost all researchers involved in the recent studies calling for more investigation on the matter.

While some consumers may experience discomfort after consuming edibles, including bloating, gas, heartburn, or constipation, there's no evidence to suggest that this is indicative of any form of liver damage.
<h5>What Happens In The Liver When You Eat Edibles?</h5>
Anyone who has tried smoked or vaped forms of cannabis and edibles will undoubtedly attest to the fact that the effects of each can vary significantly. The reason for this is that the liver plays a critical role in how the THC present in cannabis is metabolized.

When inhaled by smoking or vaping, cannabis enters the bloodstream directly from the lungs, effectively bypassing the liver. This means that you'll experience a quick and predictable onset each and every time.

Absorption occurs very differently with edibles. Edibles must first pass through the digestive tract and can take significant time to kick in, depending on how much food is currently in the stomach and intestines.

The competition in the intestinal tract for absorption doesn't explain why the effects of edibles are often substantially stronger than smoked or vaped forms of cannabis. This is due to the role of the liver in how THC is metabolized. When ingested, the THC present in cannabis is in the Delta-9-THC form. The liver then converts it to the more potent 11-Hydroxy-THC. In addition to being more potent, 11-Hydroxy-THC is also more bioavailable, and many scientists claim that it actually crosses the blood-brain barrier more readily.
<h5>The Liver and The First-Pass Effect</h5>
Sometimes when people consume edibles, they may not feel the effects intensely. This is often due to what's known as the first-pass effect. This is where an efficient liver breaks down the THC to such an extent that you don't feel its effects.

If you experience this when consuming edibles, then consider eating a small fat-based meal beforehand to help ensure enhanced absorption and activation.
<h5>Cannabis and Our Evolving Knowledge</h5>
While there are many respectable scientists investigating the effects of cannabis, there are none who can currently be considered experts like in other fields of medicine. This is because there is comparatively little known about the plant.

Years of prohibition mean that cannabis research is decades behind where it might otherwise be. Given the medicinal benefits of the plant, this is a great shame. As science plays a game of catchup and the cultural stigma slowly wanes, scientists are slowly uncovering many benefits of the plant that treat a whole host of conditions. But while much of the science is positive, this doesn't mean that cannabis is entirely benign. Only time will tell whether cannabis is 100% safe.
<h2>Buy Edibles Online in Canada</h2>
If you'd like to <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/edibles/">buy edibles online in Canada</a>, then why not take a look at our selection of edibles here on My Pure Canna? We have an extensive range of edibles in a variety of delicious flavours categorized into <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/pne-grape-indica-gummies/">Indica</a> and <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/pne-strawberry-sativa-gummies/">Sativa</a>, with varying ratios of <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/mikro-thc/">THC</a> and <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/mikro-cbd/">CBD</a>. This means that no matter what your intention, whether recreational or medicinal, you'll find just what you need!

The latest science suggests that edibles are quite safe when consumed responsibly at standard doses. However, it's always worth remembering that edibles are an extremely potent form of cannabis. If you do happen to consume too much, then you may be in for an intense ride. As always, the golden rule with edible doses is to start low and go slow!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/edibles/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weed edibles for sale in Canada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it means that everyone is curious about the effects. Cannabis edibles are a useful, not to mention, delicious way to reap the plant's medicinal benefits. They are the perfect tasty package to deliver high doses of valuable <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/shop/">cannabis medicine</a> when you need it most. And if you've been wondering about the effects — yes, edibles do feel quite different.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smoked Weed Versus Edibles</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those with some experience smoking cannabis, the effects are often mild, uplifting, and pleasant. Smoking and vaping cannabis is an excellent introduction to the power of the plant. The results are relaxing, usually chill, and the onset comes on within ten minutes or less. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the mix of cannabinoids and terpenes, you may feel social, sleepy, hungry, or creative. If you smoke or vape, the high generally last between four to six hours.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, edibles are an entirely new way to experience cannabis. While the felt effects are quite similar, they can feel substantially more powerful. Unless you have a substantial THC tolerance, you may notice that an edible is much more social, sleepy, hungry, or creative than that joint you remember.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are edibles different, even if they contain the same weed as you smoke? Because your digestive tract transforms the THC into a metabolite called THC-COOH. Researchers believe that this compound is many-times more intoxicating than straight THC. The same dose of smoked versus eaten THC will feel quite different.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You'll also want to consider that it takes time to digest edibles. Instead of feeling stoned in 10 minutes, it can take up to two hours. People often assume their edibles aren't working, when they haven't completely absorbed yet. This leads to the final point. Edibles can last far longer. If you eat a big dose of THC, expect to feel stoned for eight hours or more.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Health Benefits of Cannabis Edibles</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The many weed edibles for sale in Canada are often described as medicinal. Edibles are an excellent alternative for patients looking for options beyond joints and bongs. What therapeutic benefits can you expect if you eat a juicy </span><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/ediblesmixandmatch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC-gummy bear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a dense and chocolatey brownie?</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Pain Relief</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most extensive areas of research into cannabis' medicinal qualities is around pain. </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304395902004001"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patient surveys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicate that patients prefer medical marijuana over more conventional pharmaceuticals, like oxycodone. There have been many </span><a href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/182/14/E694.short"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clinical trials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into THC, <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD</a>, and other cannabinoids to treat pain.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Edibles are especially powerful for pain relief because they easily deliver larger THC doses than is feasible by smoking. Plus, the effects seem to penetrate more deeply and last longer than other routes of administration. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Banish Insomnia</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A second common use for <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/daily-cbd-focus-1500mg/">medical marijuana</a> edibles is for sleep. There is a lot of complicated science around cannabinoids and sleep, but most patients continue to report it is beneficial. The </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%252Fs11920-017-0775-9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says that THC especially improves the time it takes to get to sleep, but these effects may dissipate. If you need help getting to sleep, an edible packed with THC is a good first start.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Side Effects of Chemotherapy</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The side effects of chemotherapy are often described as more challenging than cancer itself. Chemotherapy is painful, kills appetite, and induces nausea and vomiting. Cannabis, primarily THC and </span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD</a>,</span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">soothe pain, boost appetite, and help reduce nausea and vomiting. Plus, for cancer patients, smoking isn't always an option. Edibles make it easy to dose, as a co-therapy to chemotherapy and make the experience manageable. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Side Effects of Weed Edibles</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No medicine comes without side effects, even <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/shop">medical marijuana</a>. Thankfully, the side effects of cannabis are generally mild, well-tolerated, and short-lived. Unlike pharmaceuticals (that cannabis tends to replace), there are few long-term risks. For starters, you can't die from cannabis edibles, no matter how much you consume.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Edibles are also a </span><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/sec-gemmies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthier alternative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to smoking and vaping. Smoking and vaping can lead to some respiratory infections. Although these tend to dissipate once you stop smoking, it's less than ideal when it's happening. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Sleepiness</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some would call this a benefit, while others a side effect. It just depends on what you are using the edible for. Most cannabis-infused goodies are slightly sedative, especially those made with indica and higher-levels of THC. They don't always make for great pre-work medicine, especially in larger doses.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Red Eyes</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Red eyes are one of the most visible signs of a high. Whether you smoke, dab, or eat your weed, you may find yourself standing in front of a mirror looking straight into bloodshot eyes. Red and dry eyes are annoying, but ultimately inconsequential effect of cannabis. Typically, your eyes will stay red for a few hours, but quickly go back to normal. You can always be Visine.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Paranoia</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In higher doses, THC can trigger the onset of anxiety and paranoia. Some folks who are especially sensitive to THC may find that any dose makes them start to feel nervous. If you are new to edibles or THC, it's best to start with a low dose (5 to 10 mg). This will help reduce the risk of negative experiences. And, if you do become paranoid, remember this will only last for a few hours. Eventually, the anxiousness will dissolve.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>A Total Green Out</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Greening out is what happens when you consume too much THC. Greening out generally only occurs when you consume high-potency products like concentrates, tinctures, and edibles. It can feel too overwhelming to the point people call 911. Although frightening and very uncomfortable, the experience is short-lived and has no long-lasting effects. Pay close attention to the dose, and always start lower than you expect.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health Benefits of Cannabis Edibles</span></h2>
&nbsp;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know the positive benefits of smoking weed, especially now it’s so easy to buy recreational weed online. But for some, the fun of getting high may be accompanied by negative side effects that aren’t quite as pleasant. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dry mouth is one of them, although that’s easily solved by making sure you always have something to drink during your smoking sessions. Red eyes are another that affects some people more dramatically than others, and again, there’s an easy fix for that — bring on the eye drops. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s a subset of people who have stopped smoking weed because they find it makes them paranoid. The experience is unpleasant enough they don’t want to risk it again. One </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/16/cannabis-paranoia-psychoactive-thc-mood"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests that as many as one in five people are convinced others are trying to harm them when high.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Why Does Marijuana Make You Paranoid?</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, you have to blame it on the THC. The same lovely cannabinoid that gets you high can also make you paranoid. Its psychoactive compound binds to receptors in the amygdala, the cluster of nuclei in the temporal lobe that regulates emotions like fear, </span><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/does-cbd-oil-stop-panic-attacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anxiety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, stress, and paranoia. The sudden rush of THC may overstimulate the amygdala, leaving you feeling anxious and maybe even fearful. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The amygdala, commonly called the “lizard brain,” is greatly affected by cannabis. Because pot can affect short-term memory and cause your thoughts to echo, it can produce mental distortions as well as the more pleasant psychotropic ones like intensifying colours and making food — even strange food combinations — taste amazing. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do start to feel like sinister things are happening (that phone won’t stop ringing and you don’t recognize the number; everyone will know you’re high and judge you negatively for it), it might be time to take a look at the </span><a href="https://merryjane.com/culture/paranoid-pot-8-strains-rumored-to-make-you-lose-your-mind"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kind of pot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you’re smoking rather than giving it up entirely.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD</a>, which doesn’t bind in the same way or to the same cannabinoid receptors in the brain, can moderate or eliminate the unpleasant paranoid side effects you may be experiencing when high. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With its ability to relieve anxiety and help you chill, a strain that has a lower THC:CBD ratio (in other words, has more <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD</a>), will still get you high but will help you avoid the unpleasant and irrational paranoia. Try strains like Harlequin OG, Blue Dream, or Cannatonic to see if it makes a difference. And look for strains that are higher in linalool, limonene, and myrcene terpenes.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What About the Dose?</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The more you smoke, the more likely you are to become paranoid. To some extent, it’s a simple math formula, or at least it seems to be, based on animal research done to date. But there are, of course, many other things that affect dose. THC:CBD ratio, the unique configuration of your particular brain and where your </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-46215-7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opioid receptors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are located. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Paranoia might be a more frequent side effect for you if more of your opioid receptors are located towards the back of your brain. The likelihood of your knowing whether this is the case or not is slim, however. So if you do occasionally feel paranoid when you smoke weed, try to identify the strain you were smoking and figure out whether you indulged more than usual.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037687161730220X"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests an increase of 5 mg of THC can make the difference between reducing stress and increasing anxiety. So, start low, go slow, especially if you’re ingesting a high THC strain with little or no CBD.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Other Factors Are Involved?</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brain chemistry, gender, frequency and amount smoked are all factors that can affect whether marijuana will make you start to feel paranoid or not. Higher estrogen levels can make you </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4161674/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more sensitive to cannabis. There are other studies indicating estrogen plays a role in </span><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171107092906.htm#:~:text=2-,Higher%20estrogen%20levels%20linked%20to,sensitivity%20in%20brain's%20'reward%20center'&amp;text=Summary%3A,according%20to%20a%20new%20study."><span style="font-weight: 400;">alcohol sensitivity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to Do if Smoking Weed Makes You Paranoid</span></h2>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chill. The whole point of recreational weed is to relax, let your cares dissipate, and get into a different - and better - headspace. Let that happen.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breath. Close your eyes and just focus on breathing in deeply through your nose, hold for a count of three, four, or five, and then breathe out deeply through your mouth. Or try one-nostril yoga breathing. If it can relax you before a root canal, it can help with a mild case of THC-induced paranoia.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slow down. You’re probably high enough. Let the joint - or the bong - pass you by for the rest of the evening. The feelings of anxiety and paranoia will fade.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More CBD. Next time you want to buy weed online in Canada, look for a slightly higher ratio of CBD to THC. You can find the same choice of different THC:CBD ratios in edibles, concentrates, and tinctures available online.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose by your Nose.Check out strains that have higher concentrations of pinene, limonene, and caryophyllene terpenes. They not only help you relax, they may help to balance, moderate and even counteract the effects of THC.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to Do if it Keeps Happening</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For a quick fix, peel and eat an orange, inhaling the fragrance of the rind as you do so. Try some yoga breathing, especially alternate nostril breathing. Five breaths with each nostril should begin to help you start to feel calmer fast.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What else? Imagine where you would normally relax. Does that look like a dog walk? A steaming cup of tea? Putting on Seinfeld or Friends? Or what about a bath, soothing music, and lowering the lights?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/shop/">marijuana</a> makes you paranoid persistently, you might need to take a break. Paradoxically, you might find that you feel a little paranoid during a break. Cannabis withdrawal syndrome can last four weeks, especially if you smoked a lot or every day. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But if your paranoia doesn’t go away, it’s time to consult your healthcare practitioner. It’s not just hard for you to deal with, it’s hard for other people to have to respond to wacky allegations or provide constant reassurance about things that aren’t really happening.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Choose Your Strain</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Start researching the strains and terpenes available wherever you buy recreational weed online in Canada. At </span><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/flowers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Pure Canna</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, shipping is free for all orders over $99, and live chat is available from 9AM to 5PM Pacific time so you can consult an online budtender for the strains, <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/concentrates/">concentrates</a>, or </span><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/edibles/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">edibles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will work best for you to ensure you get high without the unwanted side effect of paranoia. </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[More and more of us struggle with obtaining restful sleep in our busy modern lives. Between stress, racing minds, poor sleep hygiene, and exposure to the blue light from screens, insomnia is a real issue for countless people.

&nbsp;

Thankfully though, the <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/flowers/">cannabis plant</a> exhibits some potent properties that can help counteract the consequences of our modern ways. If you're wondering where to order weed online from in Canada, then here at My Pure Canna, we've got a selection that'll help make insomnia a thing of the past.

&nbsp;
<h2>How Does Cannabis Help Treat Insomnia?</h2>
Before selecting a particular strain to combat insomnia, it's important to understand which properties of the <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/flowers/">cannabis plant</a> are most likely to induce deep sleep. The cannabis plant contains hundreds of compounds that coalesce in a variety of ways to induce very different effects across the 800 or so recognized strains.

&nbsp;

THC and <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD</a> are two of the primary compounds in cannabis, and both play a crucial yet synergistic role in promoting sleep. Science suggests that THC can help induce the drowsiness that helps us fall asleep faster, but it won't improve our ability to enter the deep restorative REM sleep phase, where true rejuvenation occurs. CBD is what can help us enter those deeper sleep phases by placing us in a relaxed state with reduced anxiety levels.

&nbsp;

While both <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD</a> and THC are beneficial for sleep, the devil is in the dose. Cannabinoids are biphasic by their nature. This means that they may exhibit very different effects depending on the dose. Low doses of THC will induce mild relaxation, while high doses can promote anxiety and paranoia. <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD</a> is similar. At higher doses, it can promote alertness and thus inhibit a subject from falling asleep. This all means that both the ratio of THC to CBD and the respective doses are the main factors in how cannabis helps combat insomnia.

&nbsp;
<h2>8 Strains To Help With Insomnia</h2>
The effects of THC and <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD</a> are widely documented, but the effects of particular cannabis strains are often very personalized. With so many compounds involved in wildly different ratios, it's often a process of trial and error before finding the ideal strain. To help you with your search, here are eight strains with known properties that'll help make insomnia a thing of the past.

&nbsp;
<h2>MK Ultra</h2>
If you're looking for a sedating strain, then few beat <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/mk-ultra/">MK Ultra</a>. This delicious strain has high quantities of the terpene caryophyllene, which helps place your mind in that anxiety-free state as you wind down for bed. THC levels come in at a touch over 20 percent, meaning it's potent enough to deliver the sedation required to quell the racing mind of extreme insomnia.

&nbsp;
<h2>Remedy</h2>
A cross between Cannatonic and Afghan Skunk, Remedy is a high-CBD strain with minuscule amounts of THC. CBD levels average 13 percent, meaning that Remedy can help treat some of the barriers that prevent restful sleep. Whether for pain relief, or the lowering of stress and anxiety, Remedy can help place the body in a tender and relaxed state, primed for deep sleep.

&nbsp;
<h2>Tahoe OG Kush</h2>
The strong kush genetics of Tahoe OG <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/berrykush/">Kush</a> shine through prominently in a variety that still maintains its strong Indica qualities. This THC-dominant strain typically imparts strong sedative qualities that lack the energizing punch of competing Sativas, meaning it's perfect as the early evening hours roll around.

&nbsp;
<h2>God's Gift</h2>
If you want to wash away the day's stress and anxiety and drop into deep body awareness come the evening, then God's Gift may be the strain for you. THC levels average in at 16 percent, and the presence of high quantities of myrcene synergize with it to induce deep body sedation that will leave you primed for deep sleep come bedtime.

&nbsp;
<h2>9 Pound Hammer</h2>
9 Pound hammer will pound any racing mind into submission. With low amounts of CBD and THC levels that average around the 20 percent mark, it delivers a potent sedative punch. The terpene profile further synergizes the effects thanks to the presence of myrcene, pinene, and caryophyllene, all of which help reduce anxiety and promote relaxation.
<h2></h2>
<h2>Afghan Kush</h2>
The potent landrace Indicas that came from the valleys of Central Asia in the 1970s are still present in many modern favorites. Like many strains from the region, <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/zombie-kush-2/">Afghan Kush</a> imparts a heavy body high that'll calm a racing mind, sedate the entire body and place it in a state to prepare the body for deep sleep.

&nbsp;
<h2>Critical Kush</h2>
With Indica-dominant qualities proven the sedate, <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/zombie-kush-2/">Critical Kush</a> is a common nighttime favorite. THC levels come in at close to 20 percent, while CBD remains negligible. The synergy provoked by the terpenes myrcene and caryophyllene can induce drowsiness and alleviate anxiety. The sedative effects of Critical Kush are strong, and this is always a strain best left alone until nighttime rolls around.

&nbsp;
<h2>Northern Lights</h2>
As a unique cross between a Thai <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/daily-pen-sativa-strains/">Sativa</a> and an Afghani Indica, Northern Lights induces a relaxing vibe that leans on the Indica side. Northern Lights has an average THC content of 18 percent, and while the strain sedates, it also has potent pain-relieving properties that can be especially helpful to those that have difficulty sleeping due to underlying pain symptoms.

&nbsp;
<h2>G-13</h2>
G-13 is a potent strain that exhibits high levels of THC approaching 24 percent. The strong Indica qualities of the strain are accentuated by the presence of high levels of the terpene myrcene that serve to enhance the sedative qualities of the strain.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent wave of legalization means that it's now possible to consume cannabis in a huge variety of ways. With the option to buy concentrates online in Canada, it has never been easier to make your own edibles at home with minimal fuss. Here's how to make some delicious distillate-infused cannabis edibles at home.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Cannabis Distillate?</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/mikro-11-thc-cbd/">Cannabis distillate</a> is a potent form of concentrated cannabis created through a process known as short path distillation. It utilizes steam, heat, and pressure, coupled with varying temperatures to successfully extract and isolate cannabinoids. Such techniques mean that highly potent forms of distillate are possible, with some distillates containing as much as 99% THC or CBD widely available.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Distillates are Ideal For Edibles</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Distillates contain only major cannabinoids. Other beneficial compounds like terpenes are left behind during the extraction process. The odourless and flavourless oil that results leads to the distinct lack of flavour that could overpower a recipe, something that makes cannabis distillates very attractive to those looking for something that won't spoil the taste.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such extractions also make it easy to add when cooking. With carefully measured volumes, you can confidently add the distillate, knowing exactly how many milligrams of THC or <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD</a> you are adding. One of the main problems with homemade edibles with cannabis flower is that it's difficult to gauge the potency until you actually try them. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of stronger than expected edibles, this can often be an unpleasant experience for innocent consumers. Many people have had their super-relaxing high, suddenly transform into a fearful and anxious experience. When you are working with distillate, be sure to carefully calculate dose. Start with a small piece, and work your way up.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Distillates also come decarboxylated. This is the process whereby THC converts from its inactive form of THCA that's present in<a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/flowers/"> raw cannabis flower</a>. When consumers must decarboxylate manually, there's always the risk of doing it incorrectly, exposing it to too much heat for too long and destroying some of the compounds. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all other forms of cannabis, such as raw bud and common concentrates like shatter and <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/91-supreme-live-resin-full-spectrum-extract/">live resin</a>, all require decarboxylation. This process involves heating the flower or concentrate at approximately 150 degrees Celcius for approximately 15 to 20 minutes.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Make Cannabis Edibles with Distillate</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of making edibles with distillate is incredibly simple and doesn't require any expertise. Here's an easy-to-follow procedure that'll help you infuse the distillate with a fat source before baking.</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heat a small bowl of water to a moderately warm temperature. You'll be adding the distillate to the water, so be careful not to bring the water to the boil. Cannabinoids like THC will begin to degrade around the boiling point of water.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add some oil or butter to the warm water. Cannabinoids are fat-soluble and will require some form of fat to help ensure optimal absorption.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add the distillate into the solution and mix it thoroughly to ensure an even distribution of the concentrate.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transfer the mixture to another dish and place it in the microwave for two minutes. At this point, you can now add the fat-infused cannabinoids from the distillate to your standard baking recipe.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you place it in the oven, it's important to be aware of the temperature. The higher the temperature, the more likely you are to destroy the cannabinoids. As a rule of thumb, try and keep the temperature below 160 degrees Celsius.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Make Gummies with Cannabis Distillate</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gummies are one of the simplest forms of <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/edibles/">cannabis edible</a> to make at home and require only a few simple ingredients.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin, you'll need to gather up the following ingredients.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 cup of fruit juice</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">¼ cup of water</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 tablespoon of gelatin or agar agar.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3-5 teaspoons of sugar</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabis distillate</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Instructions</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heat the fruit juice over a medium heat.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add the gelatin or agar agar and stir until it has dissolved.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add the granulated sugar and mix it until dissolved over a slow boil.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add the cannabis distillate and stir it in thoroughly.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the solution thickens, carefully transfer it to the gummy moulds.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow them to sit at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before placing them in the refrigerator until they set.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once set, remove them from the moulds and sprinkle them in granulated sugar to prevent them from sticking.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dosing with Edibles</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dosing in </span><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/health-effects-of-consuming-cannabis-edibles/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">edibles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recipes is notoriously tricky, but distillates negate much of the guesswork involved. By using the dropper, it becomes straightforward to precisely add the amount of distillate required. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Edible portions generally start at 10 mg of THC, so depending on your experience, you can titrate your dose accordingly. 10 mg of THC is more than enough for the average consumer and should deliver noticeable effects within an hour or so of consumption. More experienced consumers, or those treating conditions like chronic pain, may require much more substantial doses and should dose accordingly.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's always recommended to buy the highest-quality distillate you can afford. Ideally, distillates should appear light yellow in colour and exhibit clear qualities due to the lack of impurities.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While distillate is easy to measure and add to any recipe, it does come with one drawback in that it doesn't contain the full spectrum of plant compounds. This means that it may not offer the same </span><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/learn-the-about-the-medical-benefits-of-marijuana/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medicinal benefit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as other forms of cannabis concentrates that preserve the entire spectrum of the plant. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for this is that the minor cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids all act synergistically to form what's known as the entourage effect. It's this mechanism that helps promote the medicinal benefits of the cannabis plant to its full extent.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The efficacy of cannabis as a treatment for cancer is still widely debated among the <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/edibles/">medical community</a>. While scientific studies on animals show much promise, the results don't always transfer across to human studies. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/">Cannabis</a> may not cure every type of cancer, but it can undoubtedly assist in certain instances, not least in helping patients manage the debilitating side effects of conventional treatments. If you want to buy <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">medical marijuana</a> in Canada and are wondering how effective a treatment it is for cancer, then here's what you need to know.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Research On Cancer and Cannabis</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in 1975, a landmark </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article-abstract/55/3/597/912322"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> demonstrated the first evidence for the cancer-fighting properties of cannabis. In the study, researchers were able to show that both THC and </span><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/does-cbd-oil-stop-panic-attacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could inhibit the growth of certain lung cancer cells, while follow-up studies showed that cannabinoids destroyed glioblastoma cells found in mice with brain cancer while leaving normal healthy cells unharmed.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, most of the research carried out on cannabis as a treatment for cancer involves animal subjects, and it shows that cannabis is effective in fighting some forms of cancer via the following mechanisms.</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promotes cell death through a process known as apoptosis.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promotes angiogenesis, a process that inhibits the development of new blood vessels in tumours.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blocks cell division.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduces the metastatic capacity of cancer cells to help curtail the spread of cancer.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabis and Cell Apoptosis</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most promising findings with cannabis relates to apoptosis. Apoptosis is the natural process whereby the body destroys old cells as it grows. At its core, cancer results from the growth of malignant cells that hide from the immune system, meaning they continue to grow despite the body's instructions to destroy them. As these cells continue to proliferate, they can soon become problematic before developing into a full-blown tumour.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidence suggests that <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD</a> can impair cancer development by inhibiting cancer cell reproduction in a process regulated by the endocannabinoid system. Research shows that <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD</a>, which indirectly stimulates the CB2 receptors in the immune system, helps alert the body to the presence of malignant growths before promoting apoptosis.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rick Simpson: A Cancer Success Story</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancer comes in many forms. And while the evidence suggests that cannabis may help treat some forms of cancers directly, the medical community is somewhat reluctant to recommend that patients use cannabis as a substitute for conventional cancer treatments.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite their reluctance, there are several instances where patients have successfully treated cancer with cannabis alone. Perhaps the most famous example is the Canadian<a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/"> medical cannabis</a> activist Rick Simpson who took to administering <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">cannabis oil</a> for a skin cancer diagnosis. He developed a high-THC cannabis oil from Indica-dominant strains, now known as Rick Simpson Oil (RSO). He applied the oil to his skin with bandages over several days and began to notice gradual improvements before his cancer eventually disappeared.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the positive anecdotal evidence, few in the medical community accept that cannabis is superior to conventional treatments. But while the jury is still out on the ability of cannabis to target tumours directly, few contest the power of cannabis to help cancer patients deal with the debilitating side effects of conventional cancer treatments.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Cannabis Helps Cancer Patients Manage Nausea, Appetite, and Pain</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One area where the efficacy of cannabis is widely accepted is in the management and treatment of the common side effects associated with traditional treatments like chemotherapy.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of those undergoing such treatments tend to suffer from nausea, a lack of appetite, and pain — three areas where <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">medicinal cannabis</a> excels. But while the benefits of cannabis in the treatment of such conditions are undeniable, patients should bear in mind that there are possible interactions between cannabis and chemotherapy medications that may compromise the efficacy of the chemo treatment.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2018 </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30583596/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shed some light on the possible interactions between chemotherapy drugs and cannabis. The interactions are due to the CYP enzymes involved in metabolizing chemotherapy drugs. When combined with cannabis, their presence may result in dangerous concentrations of toxic chemicals in the blood.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to avoid this potentially dangerous scenario is to select an administration method that bypasses the </span><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/do-edibles-damage-your-liver/https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/do-edibles-damage-your-liver/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">liver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means avoiding oral administration and consuming cannabis via inhalation, topically, or rectally to avoid potentially dangerous interactions.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabis As a Holistic Treatment</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to treating some forms of cancer, the effects of cannabis also extend to mood benefits. Many of us know how difficult cancer treatment can be, and the mood enhancement benefits of cannabis are no small thing.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether to lighten the mood, laugh with others, or to help manage chronic anxiety around the future, the benefits of cannabis extend far and wide.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When using cannabis for medicinal benefit, it's important to remember that cannabis is much more than THC or CBD. The <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/flowers/">cannabis plant</a> has hundreds of compounds that include minor cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids. When present in their natural ratios, these compounds all act synergistically to promote further medicinal benefit.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This becomes especially important when using cannabis to alleviate the side effects of traditional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy. A 2011 </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165946/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> described the role that terpenes play in enhancing the impact of major cannabinoids like THC or CBD. Cannabis strains with high quantities of the terpenes caryophyllene, linalool, and myrcene offer relief in three key areas affecting cancer patients by providing pain-relief, relieving nausea, and enhancing appetite.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy Medical Marijuana in Canada</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's important to discuss cannabis use with your medical practitioner if you have a cancer diagnosis. Several medical professionals have expressed their sadness for patients who forewent traditional treatments for advanced forms of cancer and instead opted to self-administer cannabis. While it undoubtedly helps fight some cancers and improve the quality of life of those undergoing chemotherapy, it's important to be prudent. While the future seems extremely bright for medicinal cannabis, there's still a long way to go for the medical community in understanding the full workings of the <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/flowers/">cannabis plant</a>.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you'd like to buy <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/shop/">medical marijuana</a> in Canada for cancer treatment or otherwise, then at <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/">My Pure Canna</a> we've got you covered.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When it comes to the presence of chronic pain in society, the stats are truly depressing. Millions of Canadians live with moderate to severe levels of chronic pain, and a well documented opioid crisis suggests that there is a much better way to deal with it. If you'd like to buy <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/shop/">medical marijuana</a> online in Canada, then here we give you the lowdown on the best strains for pain.

&nbsp;
<h2>Cannabis and Pain</h2>
Chronic pain remains poorly understood among the medical community and notoriously difficult to control. Chronic pain is associated with a variety of conditions that often include arthritis, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, shingles, and nerve damage. The American Academy of Pain Medicine reported that treatment with painkilling prescription drugs only tends to help 58% of patients.

&nbsp;

In addition to physical discomfort, there's also an important psychological consideration for those suffering from chronic pain. Negative emotions that include sadness and anxiety are prevalent and can often confound the suffering imposed by physical pain.

&nbsp;

It's for this reason that chronic pain can be truly debilitating for some. Given the physical and emotional burden of battling chronic pain, cannabis is often beneficial in providing relief that not only targets the underlying pain, but also helps patients deal with the emotional aspects of a chronic condition.
<h2></h2>
<h2>Combating Pain With Cannabis and The Entourage Effect</h2>
Cannabis is much more than THC or <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD</a>. It's a complex mix of hundreds of compounds consisting of cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids. Compounds exhibit a synergistic relationship between one another to promote the <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">medicinal benefits</a> in what is commonly known as the entourage effect. This means that if you're looking to obtain maximum pain relief from a particular strain, then ideally, you should understand how the profile of that specific strain lends itself to pain relief.

&nbsp;

When it comes to pain relief, there are several compounds that encourage relief more than others. In general, strains that contain a mix of both THC and CBD are generally most effective. In such cases, THC can help numb pain, while CBD is useful in targeting any underlying inflammation contributing to the pain.

&nbsp;

Terpenes also play an important role in pain relief. Two terpenes to look out for include caryophyllene and myrcene. Caryophyllene is very effective at targeting pain and inflammation, while myrcene induces the sedation and relaxation that helps many patients deal better with chronic pain.

&nbsp;
<h2>The Best Weed Strains For Pain</h2>
With over 800 recognized cannabis strains globally, it's not easy for newbies to figure out just where each strain excels. Each strain exhibits a range of qualities that vary widely, and here we narrow it down with a selection of strains that harbour the unique profile to excel in the pain domain.

&nbsp;
<h2>ACDC</h2>
ACDC is a reliable companion for many of those who live with chronic pain. With a high ratio of <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD</a>:THC, the strain comes in with 14% CBD and negligible levels of THC. Such ratios mean that ACDC is popular among those who can't tolerate the intoxicating effects of THC, meaning it's often the ideal strain for those who need to medicate while at work where they need to remain mentally sharp and productive.

&nbsp;

The predominant terpenes present in ACDC are caryophyllene, pinene, and myrcene. This winning combo, targets inflammation, anxiety, and delivers a knock-out punch to pain.

&nbsp;
<h2>Blackberry Kush</h2>
Blackberry kush is an Indica-dominant strain that's well known for its ability to tackle pain. It's also known to help quell much of the anxiety and stress that those battling chronic pain tend to suffer from.

&nbsp;

Blackberry Kush contains THC levels averaging in at 16%, with minimal quantities of <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD</a>. The terpene profile includes a synergistic blend of myrcene, limonene, and caryophyllene, each of which tackles pain, mood and anxiety all in a sweet berry flavour many have come to love.

&nbsp;
<h2>Master Kush</h2>
Master Kush is a potent Indica that's increasingly popular among those treating chronic pain. Its strong Indica genetics help promote full-body relaxation without the mental stimulation associated with Sativas.

&nbsp;

The terpene profile consists of high quantities of caryophyllene and limonene, both of which synergize remarkably well to lower pain while boosting mood.

&nbsp;
<h2>The White</h2>
The White is a hybrid strain with Indica-dominant qualities. This one is potent with high levels of THC that average in at 20%. The White exhibits a unique terpene profile consisting predominantly of caryophyllene, myrcene, and limonene that help quell pain, induce relaxation, and provide that welcome boost in mood to those living with chronic pain.

&nbsp;
<h2>OG Kush</h2>
OG Kush is renowned for its high levels of THC that can reach up to 23%. It's Indica-dominant qualities help induce pain relief and promote a mild euphoria. The higher levels of THC present mean that OG Kush is exceptionally potent, and this is probably one best reserved for when you have no prior engagements.

&nbsp;

A winning blend of the terpenes myrcene, caryophyllene, and limonene constitute the principal terpenes. Each synergizes with the THC to provide pain relief while also helping to alleviate stress and anxiety.

&nbsp;
<h2>Harlequin</h2>
Harlequin is a versatile strain that's useful in treating a host of medical conditions. This old favourite has long since been a reliable companion to those battling chronic pain. With balanced THC and <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD</a> content averaging 5% and 9% respectively, it delivers on pain relief without extreme intoxication.

&nbsp;

Harlequin is a Sativa-dominant strain, meaning that it usually provides the cerebral stimulation that many patients enjoy. The low quantities of THC ensure that the psychoactive effects won't overpower. However, the quantities are high enough to ensure some potent synergies play out between the plant compounds, meaning the strain tends to deliver excellent relief.

&nbsp;
<h2>Buy Medical Marijuana Online in Canada For Pain</h2>
<a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/daily-cbd-relief-1500mg/">Medical marijuana</a> is one of the most effective treatments for chronic pain. Compared to opioid medications, the lack of serious side effects makes it a very valid option for those who respond to it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many people from the older generations grew up in the era of “reefer madness,” where marijuana was portrayed as an inherently evil, life-destroying drug. Even with the legalization of marijuana in some countries, this opinion still stands strong due to decades of propaganda and opposition. But older generations, whose beliefs may be rooted firmly in the stigma of their times, could be among those who benefit the most from medical marijuana.

Modern research is finding all kinds of extraordinary evidence of the efficacy of marijuana for many health conditions. While it is generally accepted as helpful for such things as anxiety and <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/can-cannabis-help-treat-cancer/">cancer</a></u>, studies on using cannabis for dementia are currently underway. Since it’s possible to buy medical marijuana in Canada, this could be potentially life-changing research for many older Canadians.
<h2>What is Dementia?</h2>
Dementia is a general term that describes the deterioration of the brain and its ability to function properly. Memory loss, confusion, difficulty with problem-solving, and language loss are the most common signs. While many of these symptoms are normal signs of ageing, dementia is not. It occurs after damage has been done to brain cells that then interferes with their ability to communicate and leads to the symptoms mentioned above.

Dementia is most commonly caused by Alzheimer’s disease (a degenerative disease that accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases), but also includes vascular dementia (mini strokes, or brain bleeds, that lead to cell death) and other progressive brain diseases.
<h3>What are the symptoms of dementia?</h3>
Since dementia is an inclusive term for many ailments, pegging it down can be a challenge. In general, symptoms include:
<ul>
 	<li>Decline or loss of short-term memory</li>
 	<li>Difficulty remembering words or names</li>
 	<li>Inability to remember daily life tasks (appointments, paying bills, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Mood changes or irrationality</li>
 	<li>Behavioural changes (agitation, shouting, losing things, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Aggression or even violence</li>
</ul>
Dementia is typically progressive, meaning the symptoms worsen over time. Risk factors for dementia include age and genetics, which are both unchangeable. However, a healthy diet and active lifestyle can help postpone the onset.
<h3>Marijuana and the Brain</h3>
The human brain is a marvellously complex organ. Therefore it’s ailments are difficult to untangle. Yet research involving the brain and <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/learn-the-about-the-medical-benefits-of-marijuana/">medical marijuana</a></u> is proving the two to be quite harmonious.

Within the human body is the endocannabinoid system, which regulates the body’s responses to basic cognitive and physiological processes (memory, mood, appetite, pain-sensing, etc.). It does so by producing endocannabinoids, which are very similar to the cannabinoids found in marijuana.

Marijuana has two major compounds, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Both of these cannabinoids blend almost seamlessly with the endocannabinoids produced by the body, therefore enhancing the body’s ability to regulate many of the above-mentioned processes. <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD</a></u>, in particular, is known to have neuroprotective effects, including inhibiting progressive neurological diseases.

Because of these known neuroprotective effects, scientists have theorized that cannabis may be applicable for protecting the brain from long-term deterioration caused by the various forms of dementia.
<h3>Marijuana and Dementia</h3>
To say it straight, the current position of the Alzheimer’s Society of Canada is “[w]hile there is ongoing promising research on the effects of cannabis, there is currently no evidence that cannabis is useful for the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer’s disease.” However, the fact that they used the word ‘promising’ is promising in itself.

Currently, the greatest hindrance in cannabis studies regarding dementia and other neurological disorders is a lack of organized data. <u><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5678490/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Research</a></u> is being conducted, but methodological issues are in the way of drawing reliable conclusions.

While a doctor won’t quite yet recommend that elderly citizens buy medical marijuana in Canada, some dementia symptoms have been shown to be helped by cannabis products.

Agitation, aggression, and even violence are some of the most challenging behaviours for family members to manage. These behaviour changes often result in the person suffering from dementia being put in a home for professional care. The medical community is beginning to accept that THC is helpful for these particular symptoms by regulating energy output and brain activity. Clinical trials are ongoing to confirm these findings
<h3>Non-human Studies</h3>
Human trials are lengthy in nature and complicated to control. Dementia patients need to be studied over the course of a decade or more, so results can be painstakingly slow to acquire. Scientists have turned to testing the effects of THC on mice, and with astounding results. While some disagree with animal testing, mice in one particular study seem to be benefiting greatly from consistent doses of synthetic THC.

The test mice, who are in the late stages of their lives, are steadily administered a tiny dose of synthetic THC over the course of a month. Then they are tested against their non-medicated counterparts in problem-solving skills.

The results show that the slightly stoned mice have significantly more mental capacity for recall (memory), learning, and socializing than the non-medicated control mice. Not only that, but experiments have also shown that older mice who have lost some of their cognitive abilities can actually gain them back when given microdoses of THC.

So, how is this applicable to humans?

Many medications that are tested on mice don’t necessarily translate to human application. Marijuana, on the other hand, has thousands of years of history in human culture. Unlike other prescription drugs, it is known to be mostly benign in terms of long-term negative effects on the human body.

It is multi-fold in its application, covering a variety of ailments with limited side effects. If marijuana can be proven useful for dementia, it could change the lives of tens of millions of people around the world.
<h4>Things to Keep In Mind about Dementia and Cannabis</h4>
Talking about dementia involves talking about the elderly. Elders deserve our respect and our care, so it’s imperative to be mindful of any recommendations. Before you offer your grandpa a tasty little <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/edibles/">edible </a></u> or a spoonful of <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/mikro-honey-cbd/">CBD honey</a></u> for his cup of tea, remember that marijuana can have negative effects on memory, balance, and alertness.

These effects may be counterproductive in trying to protect those already suffering from a loss of brain capacity. A poorly judged dose could contribute to an accident and, therefore, a decrease in quality of life.

Ageing brains need all the help they can get, especially if they begin to suffer from the effects of dementia. If it seems like the right fit for the patient, talk with their healthcare provider. Buying medical marijuana in Canada for specific dementia symptoms that cannabis is known to help with, like agitation, aggression, or difficulties sleeping, may be just the helping hand an elderly brain needs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Weed culture is rife with slang: herb, bud, ganja, chronic, blazing, toking, doobies, spliffs, and so on. Some of it is obvious, and some terms require a bit of research. But if you’ve ever heard of “the munchies,” you could probably wager a good guess as to what it means.

The munchies are the uncontrollable desire to eat that you get after you smoke your favourite<a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/flowers/"> flower</a>. It’s the need to snack on something sweet, to chomp on something crunchy, to drool over something delicious and pack it into your mouth as fast as you can. It’s when you just gotta munch!

But why does smoking weed make you hungry? What are the bodily mechanics that make you want to gobble up the whole kitchen? Why do you crave certain kinds of foods when you’re high? Let’s take a look.

It’s All In Your Head

The way your body reacts to <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">marijuana</a> has everything to do with your brain. The brain is home to the endocannabinoid system, which regulates many of the body’s functions, including appetite. In short, it is made of endocannabinoids, receptors, and enzymes, which all work together to keep the body running smoothly.

After you <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/shop/">buy marijuana online</a> and give it a try, the compounds start to circulate around your body almost immediately. The cannabinoids in the marijuana (which match those made by the body almost perfectly) flood your endocannabinoid system. They stimulate the endocannabinoid system by binding to many receptors at once, which has a myriad of beneficial effects. One of these effects is enhancing your sense of smell.
So Does That Mean the Munchies Come From Your Nose?

Normally, when you smell something too much, your olfactory receptor (fancy words for “smell gland”) becomes over-stimulated, and you become “numb” to the aroma. This is known as olfactory habituation. It causes an animal (including us humans) to lose interest in the object/food being smelled after a time.

In theory, when you consume marijuana, the THC stimulates the endocannabinoid receptors in your olfactory bulb, causing your nose to become extra sensitive. Since your sense of smell and taste are intricately linked, a stronger sense of smell leads to an enhanced sense of taste. This in itself can inspire a case of the munchies.

So far, THC and olfactory receptor tests have only been carried out on mice. While mice share many cognitive similarities to humans, this particular aspect of why we get the munchies is still theoretical in its application to the human brain.
Where Are the Snacks?

Triggering an enhanced sense of smell is useful if there’s food around, but sometimes there isn’t a snack in sight - and you’ll still find yourself starving.

This is because when <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/hash/">cannabis</a> is consumed, the body releases a flush of ghrelin, a hormone responsible for the sensation of feeling hungry. While ghrelin is usually released by the stomach (often when it’s empty), it can also come from the brain.

Marijuana alters how the brain reacts to ghrelin, causing you to feel hungry out of sync with your normal eating patterns. This can cause an overwhelming desire to eat, sometimes referred to as an “attack of the munchies.” When you feel your stomach grumbling, it’s truly hard to resist a trip to the kitchen.
But Wait, There’s More About Munchies!

Now, if there’s one thing we humans love, it’s the sensation of reward - not a reward like a bonus at work or getting points for using your credit card, but the physical-cognitive rewards such as scratching an itch or eating. When you reward your body by satisfying a desire, your brain releases dopamine, which makes you feel good.

Now add pot to the picture: after you buy marijuana online and smoke it (some types are even specific to appetite stimulation), your endocannabinoid system is all fired up. While dopamine doesn’t have endocannabinoid receptors, the hormone that regulates dopamine, called GABA, does. The cannabinoids from marijuana inhibit the GABA and leave the dopamine free to flood the brain.

When you combine free-flowing dopamine with a stimulated sensation of hunger and an increased sense of smell and taste, you can see how the urge to eat can ultimately become pretty intense!
Can the Munchies Be Beneficial?

Beyond satisfying the immediate need to plow a bag of chips, purposefully inducing the munchies can help certain medical conditions. Folks hindered by chronic pain or depression may lack the desire to eat altogether. Prompting the need to eat will help maintain their health by giving their body the energy it needs.

People suffering from the effects of radiation therapy for cancer often have a decreased appetite and an ongoing sense of nausea. Marijuana has been found to help with both of these side effects.

For people seeking the appetite-stimulating effects of marijuana for health reasons, it would be advisable to consider healthy snacks for munching. Visions of the munchies usually include junk food and candy. These foods are designed for brains - that aren’t high - to be extremely satisfied by the salt and fat contents (enter the reward-dopamine circuit, and you see why these foods become irresistible when you’re high).

If crunchy is your thing, try some carrot sticks or apple slices. Sweet cravings can be fed with fruit, frozen berries, or flavoured yogurts. Even a portion of homemade baking is better than packaged sweets.

If you have a hard time controlling your munchies, try having a toke before eating food that you would eat anyway (like before dinner). Drinking lots of water or herbal tea will help your belly feel full if you’ve already snacked, sparing you the excess calories - unless that’s what you’re after.

Let’s Munch!

You don’t have to smoke marijuana to get the munchies. <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/edibles/">Edibles</a> and <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/vape-pens-and-cartridges/">vaporizers</a> are effective too - in fact, any marijuana you buy online that has THC in it will do the trick. <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/vape-pens-and-cartridges/">Smoking and vaping</a> are the fastest ways to feel the effects of cannabis (including the munchies) since the THC goes directly to the blood via the lungs. <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/edibles/">Edibles</a> will give you the munchies, but they take close to half an hour to begin to kick in.

The trifecta of an increased sense of smell and taste, a flush of the hunger hormone, and unrestrained dopamine give your brain the message that it’s time to eat! Why try to fight it? If weight gain is your intention, inducing the munchies is a pleasant way to stimulate your appetite. With some healthy snacks on hand, you can feel the satisfaction of reward all through your system while doing your body some good.

Time to go rip some chronic and munch!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever seen weed edibles for sale at a dispensary and wondered what they were all about? They look like such harmless little goodies, you wonder if one itty bitty morsel could really pack that much of a punch. Well, they can, and they do!

Edibles are a fantastic way to consume cannabis but maybe less familiar to some than smoking. They operate slightly differently in the body and have a more varied outcome than smoking marijuana due to the nature of digesting them. Here we will answer a few questions, like how edibles work and how long they take to kick in.
<h2>What Are Edibles?</h2>
The term “edibles” refers to cannabis forms that you ingest (eat) rather than inhale. They often come in the form of <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/sec-fruit-salad/">chews</a></u>, gummy bears, lollipops, chocolates, mints, cookies, and so on. Edibles also include products like marijuana tea, beverages, and infused honey. Even using <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/mixed-aaa-shake-ounce-only/">shake</a></u> to make tea falls into the edible category.

Commercial edibles (like what you would buy at a dispensary) are typically made using cannabis concentrates, such as hash oil, distillates, or infused oils or butter. The oil/butter is then carefully measured and incorporated into a recipe. The final products are portioned appropriately for a reasonable dose per serving.

&nbsp;

Homemade “loaded” baked goods are edibles as well, but dosages are harder to measure. It is worthwhile finding <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/edibles/">weed <u>edibles</u></a> for sale at a dispensary, where dosages are accurately measured and reliable.
<h3>Why Take Edibles?</h3>
Edibles are a good choice over smoking in situations that require subtlety when rolling in stinking like a skunk might be less than ideal for your social standing. They tend to be more potent and long-lasting, which is ideal for certain applications (like helping with sleep) but inadvisable for others. You still get red eyes and pasties, so if subtlety is the name of the game, be sure to dose appropriately (more on this below).

If you have an ongoing lung condition, or even if you have a cough and want to be kind to your respiratory system, edibles are a great way to gain the benefits of cannabis without inhaling smoke. While cannabis is a bronchodilator, the carcinogens from burning the plant matter can be tough on the lungs. THC taken in edible form can even give relief to asthma patients due to its effects on cannabinoid receptors in the lungs.
<h4>How Edibles Absorb Into The Body</h4>
The obvious answer is: through the mouth! But clearly, there’s much more to it than that.

The process of digestion begins in the mouth. Aside from the mechanical process of chewing, chemical breakdown starts with the saliva. When you put food in your mouth, or even just before, you begin to salivate. The saliva begins the breakdown process for starches, including sugars.

Edibles like mints or hard candies that dissolve in the mouth will be integrated faster than foods that go to the stomach for breakdown. This sublingual absorption sends the THC directly to the bloodstream without having to be digested by the stomach.

If you are eating more food-like edibles (gummies, brownies, etc.), these will be sent to the stomach for digestion and integration. They travel through the digestive tract and are then metabolized by the liver.

Edibles react differently in the body than inhaling marijuana because the liver breaks the THC down into a different form than smoking does. Smoked or vaped THC presents in the body as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and gives the headier, shorter-lived high. Ingested THC turns into 11-hydroxy-tetrahydrocannabinol, which is longer-lasting and more sedative.
<h2>How Long Do Edibles Take to Kick In?</h2>
The lag time for edibles varies from person to person and is subject to many outside factors. A person’s metabolism has a lot to do with absorption time, as well as the amount of food you have in your stomach. Consuming fats with edibles makes for a more effective absorption rate and can help hasten the process. Some even claim that exercise makes edibles metabolize faster.

Typically, digested edibles will take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to kick in. Really strong edibles might begin to take effect sooner, in which case you’ll hope you didn’t take too big a serving! Effects typically peak within the first 3 hours and can last for up to 8 - 12 hours.

Sublingual candies or drops will usually begin to work within 20 minutes. However, since they go directly to the bloodstream and bypass the liver breakdown process, the THC is still in the delta-9-THC form. This form will act faster but also end sooner. Usually, cannabis in this form is taken in smaller and more frequent doses.
<h3>How to Take Edibles Safely</h3>
The best way to start your edible journey is to find weed edibles for sale at a <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/about-us/">reliable dispensary</a>. Manufactured edibles are accurately dosed and tested, which is especially crucial if you’re just starting to experiment. You can always eat more, but you can’t eat less!

The general rule of thumb with edibles is: Start low and go slow! A good starting dose for someone with a low tolerance (i.e. someone who doesn’t regularly consume cannabis products) would be a 2.5-milligram serving. Someone who tokes on the regular could start with a 5-7 milligram dose and take it from there.

It is best to wait two hours for the effects of the edibles. If, after that time, you aren’t getting the desired results, try taking another small portion.

Don’t take edibles on an empty stomach. They may process quicker this way, but it might give side effects like a stomach ache or a less pleasant high. If you must take edibles on an empty stomach, be sure to start with a smaller dose and drink plenty of water. People suffering from IBS or other digestive sensitivities may want to steer clear of edibles to avoid further irritation of their digestive tract.
<h3>The Magic of Edibles!</h3>
With an absorption rate nearly double that of inhaled marijuana, edibles give you lots of bang for your buck. There are all kinds of <u>flavours</u> and forms to check out and find what appeals to you most. If you’re interested in trying your hand or creating a custom flavour, check out our guide to <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/how-to-make-distillate-infused-cannabis-edibles/">making edibles from distillates</a></u>.

Whichever route you decide to take, remember to start low and go slow. Finding a balance with edibles can be a longer-lasting and healthier alternative to smoking marijuana. Plus, you get to snack on a tasty little vittle to get high - can it get any better?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be legal to<a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/shop"> buy cannabis online in Canada</a>, but that doesn't mean that all employers are in favour of it. Those that aren't often subject their employees to urine testing that tests for the presence of<a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/mikro-thc/"> THC</a> metabolites that show whether someone has consumed cannabis. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a urine test on the horizon, then here's what you need to know about how long cannabis remains detectable in your urine.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Long Does THC Remain Detectable in Urine?</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There's no hard and fast formula that can answer this question definitively. Several factors govern the length of time for which THC remains detectable in urine. They include the frequency of use, the dose, diet and exercise habits and genetics. But before we discuss any of those, let's explain what the urine test is looking for.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Urine tests are not designed to detect THC. Rather, they detect a metabolite known as THCCOOH that the body produces after THC consumption. This is essentially a waste product that's produced after your body metabolizes THC, and approximately 15 to 20% of the THC consumed is excreted as metabolites in urine.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Variables That Affect How Long Cannabis Is Detectable</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the primary factors that determines the length of time for which you'll return a positive test is the size of the actual dose itself. Essentially, the more potent your cannabis is, the more THC there is to metabolize and the higher the presence of metabolites in your urine.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequency of use is also another important contributor. First-time consumers may pass a urine test within 5 to 7 days. But if you're a more habitual toker and consume cannabis daily, then you may require 4 to 6 weeks before urine metabolite concentrations drop below the detectable threshold.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These time lengths are not definitive by any means as everyone has different activity levels, genetic predispositions and body weights, all of which affect metabolic rates. If you're anxious about passing a test, then you don't have to worry about peeing clear; you only need to return a reading below the testing threshold, which is still above zero.</span>

&nbsp;

<a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/what-are-the-munchies-why-does-smoking-weed-make-you-hungry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edibles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tend to stay in the body for longer than smoked or vaped forms of cannabis, but not by much. The THC from edibles may remain detectable for an extra day at most and is unlikely to affect the results of a test. The reason for this is that there is an additional stage involved in metabolizing THC with edibles. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After the THC passes through the digestive tract, the </span><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/do-edibles-damage-your-liver/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">liver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> converts the delta 9-THC present in the plant to 11-Hydroxy-THC which is later metabolized to THCCOOH.<a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/vape-pens-and-cartridges/"> Smoking or vaping</a> <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/flowers/">cannabis flower</a> or concentrates skip this step and go straight from delta 9-THC to the metabolite.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How To Make THC Leave Your System Sooner</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the urine test for cannabis relies on metabolites, one sure way to increase the rate of excretion is to speed up your metabolism.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Diet is one way to achieve this, and certain foods can speed up our metabolism. Where fat consumption raises our metabolic rate slightly, a higher consumption of protein can raise it yet further, sometimes by as much as 25% above baseline.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercise is also a major player in driving the rate of metabolism. The harder you workout, the faster you metabolize. This means that exercising heavily in the run-up to a test will help your body excrete the metabolites. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercise also leads to an increase in muscle mass and less body fat. The ratio between both of these is also an important determiner of metabolic rates. Essentially, the more muscle you have, the higher your metabolic rate and the faster you'll metabolize THC. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleansing To Beat a Test?</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're caught off guard by a surprise test, then what can you do to give yourself the best chance of passing?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have several days before the test, then you can undertake a detox program. This serves to supplement the body's detox pathways and remove metabolites at a faster rate than the body otherwise would. You can buy detox kits specially designed for <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/mikro-thc/">THC detox</a>, and many of them require seven days of use before they'll guarantee a negative result.  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a same-day test, then there are several beverages that you can concoct that'll send the detox pathways into overdrive for an emergency metabolite purge.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lemon juice, cranberry juice, coffee, or a specially formulated cleansing drink can all help you enhance the excretion rate of metabolites in the run-up to an unexpected test. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hydration levels are also critical. The more fluid you consume, the more metabolites are excreted in your urine, so it's well worth staying hydrated if you're anxious to excrete <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/mikro-thc/">THC</a> metabolites in the run-up to a test.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Urine Tests Fall Short</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Urine tests are far from ideal. They don't show how intoxicated a person may be, nor do they indicate how much a person consumed, nor when they last consumed it. Many employers have a zero-tolerance policy towards the detection of<a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/mikro-thc/"> THC</a> metabolites, and the stigma in some circles looks set to linger for some time to come. Fortunately, for those who have advanced warning of a test, it's still possible to tailor your habits slightly. By taking the above tips into consideration, you can successfully navigate the stress of being subjected to regular urine testing in the workplace. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s easy to buy weed online in Canada now, which might be why lots of people are curious about trying cannabis for the first time. One of the most common concerns among first-time users is: can I get a bad high from weed?

It’s an understandable worry - especially if you’ve heard stories of unpleasant experiences from friends. However, while bad highs do happen, they aren’t quite as scary as they sound. And they can be avoided too. Here’s everything you need to know about “bad highs” and how to avoid them.
<h2>Why Does Weed Get You High?</h2>
The secret to weed’s psychoactive effects is a class of chemicals called cannabinoids. They occur naturally in the cannabis plant. When we consume the plant (by inhaling or ingesting it), the cannabinoids interact with our endocannabinoid system - a group of receptors found throughout our brain and body.

The key to cannabis’ classic high is one particular cannabinoid - THC. THC mostly affects our brain, making us feel euphoric. The other famous cannabinoid, CBD, actually doesn’t make us feel high at all. CBD mostly affects our body, leading to feelings of deep relaxation. That’s why medical marijuana users, who don’t want to feel high, use CBD-heavy products.
<h2>What Does A Cannabis High Feel Like?</h2>
Everyone will feel a cannabis high in a different way. Typically, people report feeling euphoric, relaxed, and giggly. Some also report that they feel more creative when stoned. Another side effect is, of course, <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/what-are-the-munchies-why-does-smoking-weed-make-you-hungry/">the munchies</a> - chances are, you’ll find yourself feeling hungry as well as high.

You might also experience a “body high” - a feeling of deep relaxation, and the sense that you don’t want to move. The stereotypical image of a stoner superglued to a sofa has some truth in it!

Your high will also be affected by a range of factors, including:
<h3>Your chosen strain</h3>
Each strain of <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/flowers/">weed you buy online in Canada</a> has a unique cannabinoid profile. As well as different THC and CBD content, it will contain a range of other cannabinoids and terpenes. These will all affect how your cannabis high feels.
<h3>Your method of consuming</h3>
If you smoke or vape your weed, you’ll probably feel high within about 30 minutes. On the other hand, if you choose <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/how-long-do-edibles-take-to-kick-in/">edibles</a>, it could take up to two hours for the effects to set in. Dabbing is perhaps the most intense way to consume - you’ll feel the effects almost immediately.
<h3>Your natural tolerance and body chemistry</h3>
Everyone has a different tolerance for cannabis. Some of this just depends on your genetics and natural body chemistry. But your tolerance will also depend on how regularly you consume, how long you’ve been using for, and even your age.
<h3>Your environment and surroundings</h3>
The setting is surprisingly important when using weed. If you’re in an environment you find safe and calming, you’ll have a different experience than if you’re in a loud, stressful place. It can also depend on who you’re with, and what else has been going on in your life.
<h2>What Does A “Bad High” Feel Like?</h2>
While we all hope to have a fun, uplifting experience when we smoke weed, it doesn’t always happen. Sometimes, we get unlucky and end up with a “bad high”. A bad high can feel a lot like a panic attack or anxiety attack. Common symptoms include:
<ul>
 	<li>Racing heart</li>
 	<li>Sweating</li>
 	<li><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/does-marijuana-make-you-paranoid/">Paranoia</a></li>
 	<li>Anxiety</li>
 	<li>Delusions</li>
</ul>
The good news is, it’s virtually impossible to overdose on cannabis. While a bad high can feel very unpleasant and scary, there’s very little risk involved. That might not help when you’re in the throes of an anxiety attack, but rest assured that the feelings will pass and in a couple of hours, you’ll be feeling fine again.
<h2>How To Sober Up From A Bad High</h2>
More good news: there are a few simple things you can do to help you sober up from a bad high.
<h3>Drink Water</h3>
Staying hydrated is always a good idea, and drinking water will help you sober up. Steer clear of alcoholic drinks though - you could end up feeling much worse. It’s also worth avoiding caffeinated drinks - water or juice is the best idea.
<h3>Distract Yourself</h3>
Because a bad high is all in your mind, distracting yourself can be a great way to ease the symptoms. If you feel able, take a walk - getting your blood pumping will help too. Or watch your favourite TV show, play a video game, or chat with your friends - whatever makes you feel safe and happy.
<h3>Relax and stay calm</h3>
Try to find a calming, safe environment to help you calm down. If you’re able to fall asleep, that can be one of the easiest ways to ride out a bad high. If that’s not possible, choose a safe spot, put on some calming music, and focus on breathing slowly.
<h2>Five Ways To Avoid A Bad High</h2>
Of course, it’s better to avoid a bad high in the first place. While you might just get unlucky, there’s lots you can do ahead of time to make a bad high less likely.
<h3>1.   Know your limits</h3>
If you don’t use very often, be realistic about your tolerance. Start small - you can always have more later if you don’t feel high enough. Even if you’re a regular user, be aware of your tolerance when trying new strains, ways of consuming, or in new environments
<h3>2.   Choose a strain that suits you</h3>
If you know you’re sensitive to THC, try to choose a <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">strain with higher CBD content</a>, or other cannabinoids that you like. Over time, you’ll get a sense of which strains work well for you, and which ones to avoid.
<h3>3.   Use in a safe environment</h3>
Remember, the setting can make or break your high. If you’re nervous, make sure you’re using somewhere you feel safe, and with people who you trust. A wild house party might not be the best place to try weed for the first time - instead, try it at home with a few close friends.
<h3>4.   Pick the right method of consumption</h3>
Smoking, <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/vape-pens-and-cartridges/">vaping</a>, dabbing, and <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/edibles/">edibles</a> all affect you very differently. While smoking and vaping can hit you very quickly, edibles can sometimes offer an unpredictable high. Stick to methods you know and like.
<h3>5.   Get your dose right</h3>
Your dose is key to avoiding a bad high. Start small, and build up if you need to. It’s easier to control your dose when vaping than smoking. And when you buy weed edibles online in Canada, the dose is carefully controlled.

We can’t promise you’ll never experience a bad high - but we can assure you that it isn’t too much to worry about. As you get to know your tolerance, preferred strain, and way of using, you’ll become more confident avoiding a bad high. And even if the worst does happen, there’s plenty you can do to ease your symptoms - and sooner or later, the feeling will pass.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Medical marijuana in Canada is an exciting and rapidly growing industry. Since legalization, more Canadians are gaining access to the potential medical benefits of cannabis. Those suffering from chronic pain, recovering from injuries, or receiving chemotherapy can all benefit from the pain-relieving properties of <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/learn-the-about-the-medical-benefits-of-marijuana/">medical marijuana</a>.

<a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD oil</a>, and other cannabis products, are increasingly being used to treat migraines too. There’s a slowly growing body of evidence that suggests it could be very beneficial. As all sufferers will know, migraines are no joke. And any safe product that can offer relief is an exciting prospect.

So if you’re considering using CBD oil to treat a migraine, here’s what we know (and don’t know) about how it works.
<h2>What Is a Migraine?</h2>
A migraine is a severe headache that can last between 4 and 72 hours. Most migraine-sufferers experience a throbbing pain on one side of the head. Nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light are also common side effects. As you can imagine, these symptoms can really disrupt your daily activities.

Many people start to experience migraines in childhood, and continue to suffer from them throughout their lives. They can be triggered by certain foods or drinks, hormonal changes, stress, or even changes to the weather.
<h3>Traditional Migraine Treatments</h3>
There’s a wide range of medications available on the market to treat the symptoms of a migraine. However, not all of them are suitable for everyone (for example, if you have high blood pressure or are at risk of stroke). And some have side effects that many patients don’t want to risk.

Opioids are sometimes used to treat severe migraines - but as we know, opioids are extremely addictive. Even over-the-counter drugs, like aspirin and ibuprofen, can be damaging to your stomach and liver if taken for long periods of time. It’s no wonder then, that CBD oil has begun to emerge as a promising treatment for migraines.
<h4>Can CBD Oil Improve Migraine Symptoms?</h4>
Over the last few years, medical marijuana in Canada and elsewhere has grown more and more popular. However, often the scientific research lags behind the anecdotal evidence - and the same is true for using CBD oil  to treat migraines.

However, there are some studies that suggest medical marijuana can help lessen the pain and severity of migraines. For example, this research paper from 2016 showed that migraine frequency reduced from 10.4 to 4.6 headaches per month with use of medical marijuana. And this study found that many patients were able to replace prescription opioids with medical marijuana.
<h5>How Does Cannabis Affect our Bodies?</h5>
So how does it work? All cannabis affects our body by interacting with our endocannabinoid system. This group of receptors, found throughout our body, was only discovered fairly recently, and still isn’t very well understood. We have cannabinoid receptors in our brains, immune system, and our nervous system.

Cannabis contains chemicals called cannabinoids that are similar to natural chemicals in our body. When we ingest these cannabinoids, they interact with our endocannabinoid system, changing the sensations we feel.
<h3>How Can CBD Treat a Migraine?</h3>
CBD (or cannabidiol) is one of the most common cannabinoids found in most strains of marijuana. Scientists don’t yet know exactly how it interacts with our cannabinoid system. But we do know it has anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects throughout the body. It’s also worth noting that CBD isn’t psychoactive - which means it won’t doesn’t get you high.

So, although we don’t know for sure, it seems those anti-inflammatory and pain-relief properties of CBD could help treat migraines. There’s a lot more research needed here. But the good news is, CBD oil has very few side effects, so it’s okay to try it out and see if it works to relieve your migraine symptoms.
<h4>How To Use Cannabis to Treat Migraines</h4>
There are lots of different ways to use cannabis to treat migraines. Smoking, vaping, edibles, and <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD oil</a> will all have similar effects. Which method you choose will depend on your personal preferences, tolerance, and migraine symptoms. A few things to consider are:

<strong>1.   THC vs CBD</strong>

CBD is known for its pain relieving properties, and like we mentioned, isn’t psychoactive. THC (or tetrahydrocannabinol) is the other most common cannabinoid in weed. It <em>is</em> psychoactive, so any product with THC will get you high.

It also has additional pain relieving effects, so you might want to <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/marijuana-for-pain-the-best-weed-strains-for-chronic-pain-relief/">experiment with different strains</a> to find the right mix for you. Bear in mind though, that if you want to relieve migraine symptoms and go about your daily life, a CBD-dominant product (like CBD oil or CBD edibles) might be better for you.

<strong>2.   Method of Consumption</strong>

Some medical marijuana patients in Canada prefer smoking or vaping. These methods provide more instant relief. They also typically involve consuming dried cannabis flower, which can have a full cannabinoid profile and therefore potentially a more potent effect.

Others prefer edibles or oils that dissolve under your tongue. These methods can take a while to have an effect, but it can be easier to manage your dose than with smoking. This is especially true in Canada, where medical marijuana is regulated by Health Canada, so you can be sure that the dose on the packet is what you’ll receive.

<strong>3.   Dosage</strong>

Because using medical marijuana to treat headaches isn’t well understood, there’s no clear guidance on dosage. The right dose for you will depend on your tolerance, familiarity with CBD products, and your natural body chemistry. We’d recommend starting small and working up from there.

<strong>4.   Side Effects</strong>

There are very few known side effects of CBD oil or edibles when used for medical marijuana. Especially compared to over over-the-counter and prescription drugs, CBD is safe and has limited side-effects. Some people do experience nausea and drowsiness though.

And of course, if you take too much, you could experience “<a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/can-you-get-a-bad-high-from-weed/">greening out</a>”. While not particularly dangerous, it can be an unpleasant experience - so, like we said, start small.
<h2>CBD Migraine Treatment: Cause for Optimism</h2>
If you’ve suffered from migraines throughout your life, any potential new treatment is a cause for excitement. And CBD oil is especially exciting because it is safe, has few side effects, and is easily accessible throughout Canada. Medical marijuana is now safely available online, so you can experiment with finding the right product and dose to ease the pain of regular migraines, and get back to regular li]]></content:encoded>

Each one has its own unique characteristics, taste, colour, and most importantly, a different effect on our bodies.  Figuring out your favourite strain is part of the fun.

And for many users, once they’ve developed some tolerance for cannabis, strong strains start to appeal. If you’re looking for an intense high, there’s no shortage of options on the market these days. The strength of cannabis strains has increased on average from 4% in 1995 to 12% in 2014!

That’s some potent weed, and it’s not for everyone. But if you want to experiment with strong cannabis strains, here’s a guide to some of the classic, strongest options on the market today.
<h2>What Makes a Strong Strain of Weed?</h2>
Cannabis has lots of different effects on our bodies and mind. These effects are caused by a group of chemicals called cannabinoids that are found in all cannabis plants. The most common cannabinoids are THC and CBD, although there are up to 100 more.

CBD mostly affects our bodies, reducing pain and inflammation and leaving us feeling relaxed and calm. THC is responsible for the psychoactive effects of cannabis - the euphoric high that many users are looking for.

So when people talk about “strong” strains of weed, they usually mean high-THC strains that have strong psychoactive effects. So how come some strains are stronger than others?

Each strain of weed you see for sale - from girl scout cookies to purple haze - has been bred to have specific properties. Every strain will have a different amount of THC, CBD, and other cannabinoids, as well as other important chemicals called terpenes.

So the strength of a strain will depend on its genetics, but also on the environment where it was grown. How high you get will also be influenced by how you choose to consume your cannabis, your environment, and your personal tolerance levels.
<h3>What Does It Feel Like To Use a Strong Cannabis Strain?</h3>
Potent, high-THC strains have strong psychoactive effects. You’ll feel a sense of euphoria, intoxication, and elation. You’ll likely also notice your cognition, memory, and perception of time are altered. For regular users with a high tolerance, using a strong strain can provide the intense high that they’re looking for.

For less experienced users or those with a lower tolerance, a strong strain can be a less positive experience. Anxiety, paranoia, and a sense of panic can be unpleasant side effects of a high-THC strain. While not seriously dangerous, it can be very uncomfortable and overwhelming to overdo it on strong cannabis strains.
<h4>Tips for Trying The Strongest Cannabis Strains</h4>
Because strong strains almost guarantee an intense experience, it’s worth taking into account some safety tips before you use, to avoid a <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/can-you-get-a-bad-high-from-weed/">bad high</a></u>:
<ul>
 	<li>Start small! You probably won’t want to use as much as you normally would if you’re chosen a stronger strain. There’s no harm in starting with a small amount and seeing how you feel.</li>
 	<li>Don’t use high-THC strains all the time. There’s some evidence that high-THC strains have stronger links to psychosis and are more addictive. So save these strong strains for special occasions.</li>
 	<li>Think about how you consume. For example, dabbing is more intense than smoking, so dabbing a high-THC strain will be <em>even more intense. </em>It’s best to choose a method of consumption that you’re comfortable with, and where you can manage your dose carefully</li>
 	<li>Choose a safe environment. To limit the negative side effects of a serious high, consume in a place you feel comfortable, with people who you trust. Make sure you have some water on hand and don’t mix your weed with alcohol.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Strongest Strains of Weed in Canada</h4>
&nbsp;

With all that in mind, here are five classic strong strains of weed for you to explore:

<strong>1.  Girl Scout Cookies/GSC</strong>

Girl Scout Cookies, with its purple leaves and orange hairs, is a Cannabis Cup-winning strain that has recorded THC levels of up to 28%. It’s known for an intense euphoria and sense of relaxation and is a hybrid strain with a sweet smell and taste. GSC also has powerful medical benefits and is used for treating pain and inflammation, as well as depression.

<strong>2.  Sour Diesel</strong>

As the name suggests, Sour Diesel has a chemical aroma like gasoline. That hasn’t hurt the popularity of this sativa strain. The high from Sour Diesel is a “head high”: very euphoric, creative, and energetic. Its THC content sits around 21-24%, which is plenty, and the high can be overwhelming for new users.

<strong>3.  Bruce Banner</strong>

Any strain named after the Incredible Hulk is going to pack a punch, and Bruce Banner lives up to its namesake. With THC content up to a whopping 30%, this isn’t a strain to take lightly. Bruce Banner is a hybrid strain, which gives a relaxing body high in addition to the initial euphoria. It’s also a good painkiller and often used to treat depression and anxiety.

<strong>4.  Godfather OG</strong>

Godfather OG is an indica strain known for its extremely relaxing effects: couch-lock is a real possibility here. It has strong sedative effects and can be used to treat <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/best-cannabis-strains-that-could-help-treat-insomnia/">insomnia</a></u>, anxiety, and stress. With an average THC content of 25%, Godfather OG offers an intense high and is a favourite with users looking to mellow out completely.

<strong>5.  Gorilla Glue</strong>

<u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/cosmic-gorilla-glue-shatter/">Gorilla Glue</a></u> is a strain that appeared in 2016 and has up to 28% THC content. It’s a 50/50 hybrid with an initial euphoric high followed by intense relaxation. Another sedative strain, Gorilla Glue is often used to treat insomnia and anxiety. It can be a bit overwhelming for new users, and some people might experience paranoia or anxiety the first time they try it.
<h3>Start Exploring Strong Cannabis Strains For Yourself</h3>
As cannabis strains get stronger and stronger, more users are drawn to the intense highs they offer. It’s definitely worth taking it easy when you first start exploring strong cannabis for yourself. You might be surprised by just how strong the effects are, especially if you’re used to more mellow strains.

But there’s lots to be said for the all-encompassing experience of a truly intense high. Whether you’re looking for stress relief, euphoria, or just to forget the world for a bit, these strong strains like girl scout cookies and purple punch can offer an unforgettable experience. There’s plenty more where they came from too: don’t just stick to our recommendations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’ve ever seen marijuana concentrates for sale, you may have wondered just what they are. What exactly is shatter? What’s the difference between an oil and a tincture? Isn’t hash just another word for weed? Why get all fancy when you can just smoke <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/flowers/">dried herb</a></u>?

Well, it turns out there are a few reasons why people prefer concentrates over traditional bud. Before we dive into the ‘why,’ let’s take a peek at just what concentrates are — and specifically CBD concentrates.
<h2>What Are Concentrates?</h2>
A concentrate, chemically speaking, is something expressed in a condensed form, or something made less diluted by eliminating fluid (water). In terms of marijuana, concentrates refer to such products as tinctures, infused oils, hash, shatter, wax, and dabbable oils. They are chemically more dense in psychoactive compounds than the whole flower, either leaning towards high THC or CBD content.

Hash, oils, and <em><u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/daily-thc-thc-tincture-300-mg-natural/">tinctures</a></u></em> are old methods of concentrating cannabis. Hash is made from collecting trichomes (the sticky crystals) from the mature buds of cannabis plants and either pressing or rolling it into bricks or balls. Tinctures are made of plant matter steeped in alcohol in a specific ratio. Oils are much the same but steeped in oil instead. Whether alcohol or oil is more effective at extracting the compounds is plant-specific.

Shatter, wax, and dab oils are a more modern and complex form of making concentrates. Shatter, so named for its brittle and semi-translucent glass-like appearance, is made by extracting the desired compounds from the fresh/cured herb with a solvent. The resulting oil-like liquid is then heat-treated to remove the solvent and leave just the concentrated compounds of the marijuana plant. The final processing of the concentrate determines whether it ends up as shatter, oil, or wax.

CBD products, in particular, are made from the hemp plant. Hemp is very low in THC, which is perfect for those seeking the benefits without the high. The hemp matter is treated with the same process as cannabis to make CBD concentrates. Once the concentrate is extracted, it is ready to be dabbed.
<h2>What Is Dabbing?</h2>
Dabbing refers to inhaling vaporized cannabis concentrates. It involves using either a specialized bong-type device called a dab rig or a <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/vape-pens-and-cartridges/">vape pen</a></u> designed explicitly for concentrates. With a dab rig, the nail is heated with a torch and allowed to cool slightly before introducing the concentrate. Vape pens work similarly to regular dab rigs, with the added benefit of a more controlled temperature.

For serious dabbers, there is such a thing as an e-rig. This compact electric dab rig heats the nail with a battery rather than a torch. The temperature can be set to the user's specifications, which is important so as not to burn the concentrate. E-rigs are prized for their portability and simplicity, though they will set you back a few hundred dollars for a good set-up.
<h2>Why Would I Dab?</h2>
So you’re pondering over <strong><em><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/concentrates/">marijuana concentrates for sale</a></em></strong> - the shatter looks so pretty, but is it really worth it? Well, yes, as a matter of fact, it is!

The best part of marijuana concentrates is the elimination of the carcinogenic plant material that one would normally inhale from smoking dried flower. Smoking a whole joint is hard on the lungs, not only due to the unwanted chemicals that come with combusting plant matter but also the heat of the smoke itself. Dabbing results in a cleaner, cooler vapour that is easier on your airways with instantaneous effects. The high is typically more potent than just smoking weed.

With shatter, in particular, you need very little product per use. Because the concentrates are so pure, you can use tiny portions to make your shatter go a long way. Due to its chemical structure, shatter is very shelf-stable and can maintain its potency longer than waxes or oils.

Admittedly, the downside to dabbing is that it requires multiple pieces of specialty equipment. Unlike <em><u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/edibles/">edibles</a></u></em> that you can pop in your pocket to take along for later, dabbing requires several items that aren’t the most portable. Let’s jump into how dabbing works to explain the necessary equipment.
<h3>A Step By Step Guide To Dabbing</h3>
First and foremost, please make sure your concentrates come from a <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/shop/">reliable source</a>! While it is possible to make homemade concentrates, the risk for unremoved solvents remaining in your product is high - and that is stuff you certainly don’t want to inhale. Potency should be labelled on legitimately produced concentrates to give you an idea of what you’re working with.

After you’ve found marijuana concentrates for sale from somewhere you trust, it’s time to piece together the rest of the puzzle.
<h3>You Will Need:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Concentrate: shatter, wax, or dabbable oil</li>
 	<li>dab rig</li>
 	<li>dab tool</li>
 	<li>a nail that fits your rig</li>
 	<li>torch</li>
 	<li>carb cap (optional, but increases efficiency)</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Do It:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> prep your dab rig according to type. Portion out a tiny bit of your concentrate - as we know, they are powerful (which is the whole point), so start with the tiniest portion you can collect with your dab tool. You can always dab more if you need to.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Step 2: </strong>heat your nail. Unless you have an e-rig, you’ll have to do this using a torch. Heat the nail until it is just starting to turn red. Let it cool for 30-60 seconds; ideal dabbing temperature is 350-400°. If you can comfortably (and carefully!) hold your hand about half an inch away from the nail, it is ready.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> slowly lower your dab tool and concentrate into the nail. It should melt upon contact with the rig and begin to vaporize. Inhale long and slow until all the concentrate is gone. If you have a carb cap, pop that on top to keep all the vapour in while you inhale.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Exhale immediately. If you have the wherewithal to clean your nail right away, do so by letting it cool down a bit, then swiftly wiping it with a cotton swab.</li>
</ul>
If getting yourself all set up with a dab rig seems overwhelming, try starting with a dab pen. Pens aren’t as efficient as a dab rig and will require multiple hits to achieve the same effect, but they are simpler and more portable to use.
<h2>Benefits of Dabbing Concentrated CBD</h2>
If you’re medicating with CBD for health reasons, it makes sense to introduce it to your body as cleanly as possible. Dabbing a high-quality <em><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD concentrate</a></em> eliminates the risks associated with smoking grass and delivers all the good qualities directly to your bloodstream. It is easier on your lungs, more immediate than edibles, and offers the user a chance to appreciate the enticing flavours of marijuana that are otherwise clouded by burning the herb.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the most notable characteristics of marijuana is the smell. You know it when you smell it - often skunky, sometimes fruity, and possibly even <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/chocolatina/">cheesy</a></u>! That strong, delicious aroma is an indicator of quality bud, and can be a little intoxicating in and of itself.

The source of this smell is the terpenes found in cannabis plants. When you <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/shop/">buy weed online</a> in British Columbia or from a dispensary, you will see a description of the smell and flavour, or even a specific list of terpenes. If that list has ever confused you, read on to find out just what terpenes are and why they are a desirable attribute in a good-quality bud.
<h2>What Are Terpenes?</h2>
Terpenes are aromatic oils that produce the pungent smell and flavour found in marijuana. Terpenes are not unique to cannabis - strong-smelling plants, such as cedar, pine, sage, tea (black), and citrus, contain easily recognizable terpenes. Their purpose in the plant world is to attract pollinators and repel predators. The smell, flavour, and colour of plants are all due to terpenes.

There are tens of thousands of known terpenes, and about a hundred of those can be found in cannabis plants. Strains of marijuana are selectively bred to build the potency of certain terpenes. This is often reflected in the name of the bud (think <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/kushberry/">Kushberry</a></u>, a cross between OG Kush and Blueberry - noted for its blueberry flavour).
<h3>What are the Expected Effects of Terpenes?</h3>
Terpenes work in the body much more subtly than cannabinoids. While it is still debated whether they work psychologically or pharmacologically, it is clear they interact with the body in many ways.

Each terpene has individual effects that are sought after depending on the user’s intentions. If you buy weed online in British Columbia, some of the most common terpenes you might see listed are:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Myrcene: </strong>promotes a sensation of relaxation/sedation. Considered anti-inflammatory and has anti-tumor properties. Has an earthy flavour and is found in other plants such as thyme, juniper, and fennel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Caryophyllene: </strong>a terpene unique in the way that it also acts upon the endocannabinoid system. Has anti-inflammatory and pain-reducing properties, as well as sedative effects. The flavour is spicy. Found in black pepper, cardamom, and cumin, to name a few.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Pinene: </strong>useful for memory retention, alertness, and counteracting an overdose of THC. Potential for treating, pain, inflammation, and asthma. Described as having a “woodsy” flavour. It is the most common terpene in the plant kingdom and is found in such strong-smelling plants as pine and rosemary.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Linalool: </strong>promotes mood elevation and a sense of calm. Considered useful for anxiety and depression, insomnia, pain, and inflammation. Has a floral aroma and is also found in soothing plants like lavender and chamomile.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Limonene: </strong>provides relief from stress and anxiety. Has potential for cancer treatment, as well as anxiety, depression, pain, and inflammation. Has a citrus aroma and is found in plants like citrus fruit peels, peppermint, and rosemary.</li>
</ul>
As you can see, terpenes have many different effects that often overlap between varieties.
<h4>What’s the Difference Between Terpenes and Cannabinoids?</h4>
Cannabinoids interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system (ES) by activating the CB1 and CB2 receptors. Your body naturally produces endocannabinoids that work within the ES to maintain balance in your body. When you introduce cannabinoids from an external source, the effect on your body can be quite strong.

THC is the cannabinoid responsible for getting you high, as it floods your ES and enhances the cannabinoid-receptor function. CBD works on different receptors and is credited with such effects as relieving pain, inflammation, <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/best-cannabis-strains-that-could-help-treat-insomnia/">insomnia</a></u>, and <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/does-cbd-oil-stop-panic-attacks/">anxiety</a></u>. Cannabinoids are exclusive to cannabis plants.

Terpenes, however, are absorbed by the body and utilized in different ways. They aren’t considered psychoactive the way THC is but are believed to have many more subtle effects. Since they are found in so many other plants, we inadvertently consume terpenes every day in foods we regularly eat.

Terpenes and cannabinoids work together within the body to provide a range of experiences. This symbiotic partnership is referred to as the entourage effect.

All of the compounds that enter our bodies upon consuming marijuana give a variety of effects depending on the specific combination of terpenes and cannabinoids. The entourage effect is still considered theoretical, though in-depth <u><a href="https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01238.x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">studies</a></u> have shown proof of this theory.

<strong>Are There Any Medical Benefits from Terpenes?</strong>

As mentioned above, the beneficial effects of terpenes are innumerable. They are anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, anti-anxiety, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and anti-cancer. These effects contribute to positive impacts associated with reducing stress, insomnia, and depression. It is even theorized that some terpenes assist in reducing memory loss associated with chronic consumption of THC.

To gain the maximum benefits from terpenes, they are best consumed in a low-heat form. <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/vape-pens-and-cartridges/">Vaporizing</a></u> is the fastest way to get the compounds from cannabis into your body relatively intact. Some terpenes are more effectively taken as edibles, while others work best applied topically.
<h2>High-Terpene Products</h2>
Suppose you’re on the lookout to buy weed online in British Columbia that is high in terpenes. In that case, you should familiarize yourself with the cannabis grading system. If you take a look at our <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/flowers/">list of flowers</a></u>, you’ll notice that each type has a grade: from AAAA down to A.

As you may have deduced, AAAA is top-quality bud. This indicates that the aroma, flavour, and appearance of the strain have all come together to form a nearly perfect product. The terpene content is high, making for a potent and pleasant smell. The trichomes are readily seen, giving an eye-catching cover of crystals, and the buds are dense and well-formed.

AAA grade herb would be considered standard for purchasing marijuana - still of excellent quality, but slightly less perfect than AAAA grade. The smell and flavour should still be strong and enjoyable with relatively dense buds. The colour may not be as vibrant, but as long as it isn’t showing any signs of browning it can still achieve an AAA grade.

AA and A grade weed are cheaper and of lesser quality, though it is still possible to find decent <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/mandys-dream/">AA grade</a></u> bud.

You may also see products listed with the letters HTFSE in the name. This stands for High Terpene Full-Spectrum Extract, a high-tech product created with the intention of preserving the terpenes and eliminating the waxes, lipids, and fats. The term “full-spectrum” refers to keeping most of the compounds intact. HTFSE products are typically 13 to 40 percent terpenes.

Live resin is another high-terpene form of cannabis. It is made from fresh green marijuana that has never been dried or cured. A flash-freezing process is used to extract the oils, which keeps them intact for maximum potency. Live resin is typically dabbed.
<h2>Take A Look At Terpenes</h2>
Hopefully you have learned enough about terpenes to pique your curiosity! Keep an eye on flavour descriptions to get an idea of what kind of terpenes are present in strains you enjoy. Take a moment to appreciate the smells and flavours and recognize the beautiful role of your new friends, terpenes.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Uh oh! Looks like someone has the munchies! With your appetite buzzing and stomach rumbling, it comes as no surprise that you’ve got food on the brain. So what are you going to eat? Are you going to buy something savoury or make something sweet? Or do you plan to skip out on the snacks altogether, using your willpower to prevent that fridge from opening?

While some who use medical marijuana might dislike the munchies for fear of gaining weight, others may find those very same appetite-boosting qualities both desirable and necessary. A considerable number of physical illnesses and mental ailments affect appetite, in some cases severely. This includes diseases requiring extreme treatments like radiation and the wasting-syndromes that affect individuals with cancer, HIV, or AIDS.

Whether it is encouraging you to demolish an entire plate of chocolate chip cookies or allowing you to enjoy your first meal in a while without nausea, cannabis is good at what it does. But how exactly does cannabis affect appetite?

Read on to learn about the science behind medical marijuana’s hunger-stimulating aspects. Plus, discover some of the top appetite-boosting strains, so the next time you order <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/about-us/">medical marijuana online</a></u>, you’ll be able to find the ideal strain for your needs.
<h2>How Do the Munchies Work?</h2>
There are libraries of research already published on the topic of cannabis, with new studies into the hunger-boosting effects of cannabis are underway. Of course, the idea of munchies is nothing new. Jokes on the topic have been popular since the days of Cheech and Chong, if not much earlier.

In our current age, food products and restaurant corporations advertise directly, though often subconsciously, to couch-bound stoners. Just consider the click-of-button ease all those delivery apps offer.

Although not everything is known in regards to the craving-driving force of marijuana, some effects have been confirmed. One of the most well-known aspects of cannabis is one of its most prominent cannabinoids: THC. Tetrahydrocannabinol is a powerful, psychoactive cannabinoid known for eliciting a number of mind-altering effects and physical sensations.

So how does this work? When cannabinoids enter the body, whether through inhalation, ingestion, or applied as a topical, they interact with the endocannabinoid system, a natural system found in mammals that regulates immune response, metabolism, and appetite. The endocannabinoid system includes two main receptors, CB1 and CB2.

The CB1 receptor is found in various systems throughout the human body. Some of the key systems containing CB1 include several parts of the brain: the basal ganglia, hypothalamus, limbic forebrain, and rhombencephalon. When triggered, pleasure and flavour are greatly enhanced, while the ability to regulate food intake may become impaired.

THC can lead to an increase in the production of ghrelin, an <u><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6200580/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">appetite-stimulating hormone</a></u> common in both the stomach and small intestine. It also has the ability to slow the production of PYY, an amino acid that regulates ghrelin-levels.

On a <u><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10862001_Cannabinoid_system_as_a_modulator_of_food_intake" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">neurological level</a></u>, THC can activate certain pathways, one being the mTOR pathway, which, again, increases ghrelin production. Furthermore, THC can activate POMC neurons, a specific kind of neuron influenced by the CB1 receptor. When affected by THC, POMC neurons have the ability to open or close specific pathways that either increase or decrease appetite.

Other factors amplified by cannabis that might inspire consumers to continue eating include lowered inhibitions and slowed reaction-time. With such a distinct spectrum of effects, it’s always best to do your research and read up on your strain of choice before you order medical marijuana online.
<h3>Why Would You Want the Munchies?</h3>
For a large portion of our population, the munchies are a nuisance. Between the extra calories and rapidly dwindling snack cupboard, it isn’t a surprise that the average joe might find a bolstered appetite more negative than positive.

But if you are living with a chronic physical or mental illness that affects your appetite, those so-called munchies could be a life-saver. Rather than seeing inflated hunger and the potential for weight-gain as a detriment, many actually require something to stimulate their appetite, subsequently allowing them to gain weight.

Some of the more well-known illnesses that can cause severe and unintended weight loss include cancer, kidney disease, HIV, and AIDS, just to name a few. Aside from the general exhaustion associated these ailments comes the potential for life-threatening deterioration of tissue, bone, and muscle known as cachexia. More commonly known as wasting syndrome, this not-yet-fully-understood occurrence changes the characteristics of one’s body, influencing function and affecting organs.

While scientists are still working towards discovering the exact cause and potential cures for cachexia, studies involving cannabis show promise. In addition to cachexia, a number of other cancer symptoms and side effects of treatment can result in a loss of appetite and increased weight loss.

Inflammatory cytokines, which can both cause cancer and increase susceptibility to cachexia, also have the potential to speed up metabolism. Fast metabolism means you are burning fat and spending calories necessary to fight debilitating diseases.

Some therapies aimed at fighting cancer are known to be harsh on the body, damaging cells and causing further deterioration. One of the most notable side effects of both chemotherapy and radiation, is nausea accompanied by vomiting.

An abundance of studies and clinical trials focused on THC’s antiemetic effects in relation to cancer-induced vomiting have confirmed its efficiency, both in adults and in children. Despite breakthroughs of this nature, future research will be required in order for scientists to produce a foolproof THC-based antiemetic for those in need.

Finally, the hunger-boosting powers of cannabis are of great benefit to those experiencing depression, as the effects of the disorder can be debilitating. Some people can’t even get out of bed. Between a lack of appetite and a lack of motivation, depression affects nutrition and weight to a serious degree. Introducing medical marijuana into treatment has been proven to benefit afflicted individuals.
<h4>Which Strains Are Best for Stimulating Appetite?</h4>
What better way to complete our lesson than with a listicle of some of our favourite strains?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kush is a popular, prized strain of cannabis. Years ago, before cannabis was legal, cannabis consumers were limited to the strains available. But now that we can more freely buy cannabis in Canada, we can choose strains that we prefer. Further, we can take the time to seek out specific strains, such as Pink Kush, for particular symptoms and desired effects.

Kush is a potent strain that some consider to be the best and most precious in the world.

The origins of kush are in the East, so the way it traveled here to the West has a curious history.

Kush originated in Afghanistan and India, and it is named after the Hindu Kush mountain range. Pink Kush, a hybrid kush, is said to be good for anxiety, so we wanted to learn more about it.
<h2>Is Pink Kush Good for Anxiety?</h2>
There are now multiple strains of kush available to the modern-day consumer, including Pink Kush. Now that we can <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/flowers/">buy marijuana online</a></u>, we can seek out specific strains to overcome specific challenges.

We wanted to dig into Pink Kush and its effects on anxiety, since so many people suffering from anxiety choose cannabis for relief.

What makes Pink Kush different from other strains of kush? Let’s look at:
<ul>
 	<li>Pink Kush lineage</li>
 	<li>Profile of Pink Kush</li>
 	<li>How Pink Kush affects the consumer</li>
 	<li>What would make it a good strain for anxiety</li>
 	<li>What scientific studies say about cannabis strains with this profile</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pink Kush Lineage</h3>
Stories suggest that travelers from the West brought precious kush seeds over to North America from the Hindu Kush region in the 1960s and ‘70s. Westerners traveling the “hippie trail” between Asia and Europe came upon this traditionally grown strain of cannabis that was different from what they knew.

Long before we could buy marijuana online, North Americans began to cultivate kush indoors in secrecy during times of cannabis prohibition.

Kush, or OG Kush, is an indica-dominant strain cultivated in California in the 1990s. It comes from a Hindu Kush strain crossed with a strain from Northern California. Leafly calls OG Kush “the genetic backbone of West Coast cannabis varieties.”

The cultivation of cannabis has become more and more sophisticated over the past few decades. Different strains of kush have been cultivated and are now available to North American consumers.

All kush strains of cannabis you can buy in Canada are said to come from OG Kush, and <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/tomfordpinkkushhash/">Pink Kush</a></u> is one of these.
<h4>What Are Some Aspects of the Pink Kush Profile?</h4>
OG Kush is one of the most prized cannabis strains globally, and it has some distinct properties including aroma and appearance. Pink Kush, also known as Pink OG, has a similar profile and, for some, is just as prized as its parent strain.

Pink Kush is an indica-dominant hybrid. The indica content of this strain tends to be around 80–90 percent. It is a potent, relaxing strain with a floral, sweet, earthy nose. The flavour is vanilla, sweet, and earthy.

Its terpene profile contains these, among others:
<ul>
 	<li>Citrusy limonene</li>
 	<li>Linalool, which offers a sweet or woodsy scent</li>
 	<li>Spicy caryophyllene, also found in cloves</li>
</ul>
The THC content of Pink Kush can be as high as 25 percent, so consuming even a small amount of this strain can be felt. The buds are typically green with pink and purple undertones, and the colour of the buds give Pink Kush its name.

Pink Kush is available in flower, hashish, and <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/exclusive-pink-kush-death-star-shatter-2/">concentrate</a></u> form.
<h3>Buying the Pink Kush Strain of Cannabis in Canada</h3>
<u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/island-pink-kush/">Pink Kush</a></u> is very popular in the Pacific Northwest and is cultivated in many places across the country. Pink Kush is sometimes crossed with other strains too, so you have many options to choose from, especially if you wish to find a strain with a slightly higher level of sativa.
<h3>How Does Pink Kush Affect the Consumer?</h3>
Pink Kush is typically known for its sedative and euphoric effects. This means it is both relaxing and uplifting. This blissful strain is reported to calm mind chatter and deeply relax the body.

Consumers use it for a variety of conditions including:
<ul>
 	<li>Anxiety</li>
 	<li>Stress</li>
 	<li>Insomnia</li>
 	<li>Pain</li>
 	<li>Mood disorders</li>

<h3>What Makes Pink Kush a Good Option for Anxiety?</h3>
<u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/tom-ford-pink-kush-2/">Pink Kush </a></u>is indica-dominant, so it is more relaxing than a sativa-dominant strain. Indica and indica-dominant strains tend to relax the body and cause people to slow down. This overall is good for anxiety, stress, and other symptoms and causes of these conditions.

Caryophyllene, an anti-inflammatory terpene found in Pink Kush, is the only terpene that also acts as a cannabinoid, meaning it can communicate with the endocannabinoid system in the human brain.

This <u><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24930711/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">study</a></u> looks at how cannabis strains with caryophyllene might help treat anxiety by binding with CB2 receptors in the brain. Evidence suggests there are links between CB2 receptors and anxiety, and they saw a reduction in anxious, compulsive, and depressive symptoms.
<h3>How Might Pink Kush Not Be a Good Option for Anxiety?</h3>
Because of its potency, Pink Kush can be overpowering. If a consumer tends to become paranoid, has a condition exacerbated by potent strains, or feels overwhelmed by potent strains, Pink Kush could increase their anxiety.

Pink Kush is also known to cause a dry mouth or dry and itchy eyes.

There are only a few reports of increased anxiety and stress from Pink Kush, but when dealing with a severe condition like anxiety, it's essential to be aware of the risks.

When you buy cannabis in Canada, double-check the THC percentages and ratios. People who have specific conditions, such as epilepsy, may wish to choose a strain with a higher sativa content than Pink Kush.
<h4>What Does Science Say About Cannabis Strains With This Profile?</h4>
There is much interest in cannabis as a potential treatment for anxiety. Many pop-culture references exaggerate the paranoid effects of marijuana. While paranoia and anxiety can happen with overconsumption of cannabis and with specific conditions, cannabis does seem to help more than harm.

Science is looking into how cannabis can help those who suffer from anxiety. A University of Washington <u><a href="https://adai.uw.edu/pubs/pdf/2017mjanxiety.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">study</a></u> published in 2017 clearly states that both THC and CBD can help with anxiety, and this may depend on how much is consumed: "The two primary active ingredients of marijuana, THC and CBD, appear to have different effects with regard to anxiety. Pure THC appears to decrease anxiety at lower doses and increase anxiety at higher doses."

Since Pink Kush is so potent, it seems that buying even a small amount of this marijuana strain online could help. Finding the right amount to consume seems to be key.
<h2>Pink Kush is Good for Anxiety, Possibly</h2>
Anxiety shows up differently for everyone, and its symptoms stem from many causes.

It’s best to look at all the information when using cannabis for any form of healing. One can always ask for support from a professional who can help with information, where to buy cannabis in Canada, and how to select the best strain for your needs.

Like many of the questions about cannabis, there is no 100 percent clear yes or no answer to whether or not Pink Kush is good for anxiety. Based on research and testimonials to date, however, we do lean toward a yes.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now that you can buy marijuana online, there’s no reason to settle for anything but the best. In the past, cannabis connoisseurs were limited to what was available locally. But these days, you can buy legendary strains like Gorilla Glue, Northern Lights, and Pineapple Express without leaving your sofa.

The most legendary strains are renowned for their highs, but also for their taste, smell, genetics, and history. Many of these strains have been carefully bred over decades, and all have earned their all-time status.

So which strains simply can’t be missed? That depends on what you’re looking for. Each strain offers a unique experience, and everyone will respond differently to each strain.

You might be looking for an uplifting head high that will get your creative juices flowing—try Blue Dream. Or you might be looking for deep, complete relaxation, in which case the infamous Gorilla Glue is your friend.

Whatever you’re looking for, we’d argue that all of these best-selling strains will leave you satisfied.

<strong>Gorilla Glue</strong>

Let’s start with a heavy-hitter: <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/cosmic-gorilla-glue-shatter/">Gorilla Glue</a></u> isn’t a strain for the faint of heart. But it is a hugely popular Cannabis Cup Winner that experienced users shouldn’t miss.

A hybrid with up to 28 percent THC, Gorilla Glue offers the ultimate relaxation. Numbing your mind and body completely, you’ll feel sedated but euphoric. Fair warning: This is a powerful high. We wouldn’t recommend Gorilla Glue if you’re heading to a party—or planning to do anything at all, really.

But there are few strains as sedating as Gorilla Glue. It’s an excellent strain for those suffering from insomnia or depression, or just looking to switch off entirely for the evening.

<strong>Blue Dream</strong>

<u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/bluedreamsmallnugs/">Blue Dream</a></u> is a sativa-dominant hybrid. It still packs a punch, with a THC content of up to 27 percent. But the THC in Blue Dream is balanced by a two percent CBD content.

That means you get a more balanced and cerebral high. Blue Dream will make you feel energetic and creative while still relaxing your body. It’s a great strain for daytime use and for artists, musicians, and other creative types.

Medical marijuana users find that Blue Dream’s energizing high is useful for treating chronic fatigue and pain. The lack of sedation makes this a suitable strain for daytime use for those who need it.

<strong>OG Kush</strong>

As the name suggests, <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/og-kush-2/">OG Kush</a></u> is a somewhat mythical strain that’s taken on legendary status. Thought to have originated in the 1990s from a cross with Hindu Kush, it’s since been bred to produce other infamous strains like GSC.

OG Kush is a sativa-dominant hybrid with 20–25 percent THC content. Unlike Gorilla Glue, it isn’t sedating. Instead, after a hit of OG Kush you’ll find yourself energized, euphoric, and sociable. You’ll primarily get a head high, with fewer effects on your body.

Be prepared for the potent smoke, which some users find harsh, and the pungent smell left after smoking OG Kush.

<strong>Northern Lights</strong>

If you’re looking for something a little more mellow, <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/nothernlightsozonly/">Northern Lights</a></u> could be the strain for you. One of the most popular indica strains of all time, Northern Lights is derived from Afghani and Thai landraces, which only adds to its popularity.

With up to 33 percent THC, Northern Lights will deeply affect your whole body. You’ll feel sleepy, comfortable, and lazy as you settle into the contented high. A good choice for those suffering from insomnia, anxiety, and stress, North Lights will blissfully slow down your body and your mind.

<strong>Pineapple Express</strong>

Even your grandma has probably heard of <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/xo-extracts-pineapple-express-purple-shatter-cartridge-0-6ml/">Pineapple Express</a></u>! It’s one of the few strains that has crossed over into the mainstream, with the Seth Rogen film of the same name.

The name Pineapple Express is a nod to its tropical smell and taste, with hints of pineapple, mango, and pine. A creative and energetic strain, Pineapple Express can help increase productivity and focus. It’s also a fun social strain.

For the uninitiated, Pineapple Express could lead to paranoia. Its head high is quite strong, like other sativas, and it contains around 20 percent THC.

<strong>Chemdawg</strong>

<u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/chemdawg-kief/">Chemdawg</a></u> (or Chemdog) is another legendary strain with uncertain origins. It’s a hybrid strain that hits fast and strong.

Chemdawg has an upbeat high, amplifying your senses and heightening your awareness. While the head-high is buzzy, you’ll find your body deeply relaxed. Some new users find Chemdawg a bit overwhelming, so go easy on your first hit.

Unlike the tropical notes of Pineapple Express, Chemdawg has a pungent smell and taste of diesel.

<strong>Durban Poison</strong>

This sativa strain was born in the South African city of Durban. It’s a landrace strain, part of a long history of cannabis cultivation in Africa. <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/exclusive-durban-poison-shatter/">Durban Poison</a></u> has around 15–20 percent THC. Like other sativas, it has a mostly cerebral high.

With Durban Poison, you’ll find yourself focused, creative, and sociable. There’s little risk of couch-lock here, making Durban Poison a suitable strain for daytime use.

Like other strong sativas, it can make new users feel anxious and on edge. But with experienced users, Durban Poison is extremely popular, and for good reason.

<strong>Gelato</strong>

<u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/gelato/">Gelato</a></u> is a sweet-tasting, Californian hybrid known for its balanced, mellow high. With high THC content (up to 25 percent) and little CBD, Gelato will hit your body and mind in equal measure. It’s a potent strain, and the balanced high comes on quickly.

At the same time, Gelato isn’t a sedating strain (like Gorilla Glue), and many people do choose it for daytime use. It’s said to help treat anxiety, as it feels more like an indica and therefore is less likely to cause paranoia.
<h2>The Best Strains of All Time?</h2>
Choosing the “best” strain of weed is simply not possible. There are so many diverse and unique strains of marijuana to buy online, each with its own particular benefits and sensations. You’ll not often find two users who agree on their favourite strains–and that’s how it should be.

But famous strains like Chemdawg and Gorilla Glue have earned their place in the history books. Thousands of people, over decades, must be onto something. These strains are best-selling for a reason, and we’re pretty sure you’ll love them, too.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cannabis concentrates are becoming more and more sophisticated. The diversity of options available allows consumers to choose what best suits their desired outcomes and lifestyles. Some of the options you can buy online in Canada include live concentrates. Live resin and live rosin are among these.

What exactly is a live concentrate, and how do these differ from other cannabis concentrates? Resin and rosin sound similar. Are they the same? If not, how do they differ? What benefits, if any, are there in selecting a live concentrate over cannabis flower?

In this post, we will explore these questions and more:
<ul>
 	<li>The basics of live concentrates, including techniques used to make them</li>
 	<li>Similarities and differences between live resin and live rosin</li>
 	<li>Why choose one of these live concentrates over the other</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Are Live Concentrates?</h3>
<u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/concentrates/">Concentrates</a></u> come in many forms these days. When you buy marijuana online, you will find various concentrates, from waxes, extracts, and oils, to budder, shatter, diamonds, and more. Live concentrates are different from other concentrates due to how they are extracted and processed.

Sometimes referred to as "cured concentrates," non-live concentrates are dried or cured before they are extracted. This is done to remove excess moisture. Live concentrates, however, are extracted from live, fresh cannabis. Using this method preserves the terpenes from the live plant matter, giving the concentrate a fuller aroma and flavour.

With cannabis, each compound adds to the experience, referred to as the "entourage effect." Leafly states, "Our bodies take in hundreds of botanical compounds. Each one arrives with unique effects and benefits, and their behaviour may change in the presence of other compounds. This is the entourage effect."

Because of the extraction method used for live concentrates, consumers will experience a fuller entourage effect.
<h3>How Are Live Concentrates Extracts</h3>
Live concentrates are extracted from live plant matter, and all the cannabinoids and terpenes from the live plant are preserved. Both live resin and live rosin are processed using extreme temperatures. From here, the processing methods become vastly different.
<h3>How Live Resin is Extracted</h3>
At first glance, the cost of <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/91-supreme-live-resin-full-spectrum-extract/">live resin</a></u> may be the only visible difference from other concentrates you can buy online in Canada. The real difference is in what we don't see, and that is the extraction method.

The <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/flowers/">cannabis</a></u> is not decarboxylated (heated) during extraction and processing. This method freezes live plant matter to preserve the integrity of the full profile of cannabinoids and terpenes, giving the finished product a robust aroma and flavour.

First, the cannabis is harvested, and then the live plant matter is frozen to subzero temperatures.

Next, live concentrates are put through a butane hash oil (BHO) extractor at extremely low temperatures, and high-quality live concentrate production does not use stems or fan leaves. The resulting product is a sticky resin, and the remaining solvent is extracted with a pump or vacuum in a process called "closed-loop extraction."

This method is considered dangerous and should only be done in a lab by professionals. Extraction, processing, and the necessary safety requirements drive this dark yellow concentrate's cost a little higher than cured concentrates. It is well worth the rich aroma and taste.

Live resins are available in many forms that cannabis connoisseurs who buy concentrates online in Canada will recognize, such as saps, sugars, butters, and even shatters.
<h3>How Live Rosin is Extracted</h3>
Live rosin processing is solventless. It is safer to produce than live resin, as the process uses no chemicals. It does have a few extra steps, and the resulting concentrate also costs a bit more than other cured concentrates.

Live rosin is an artisan product because it is produced manually.

After harvesting, the live cannabis is frozen. This preserves the terpenes until the producer is ready to make the live rosin.

The frozen cannabis is put in a bath of water and ice. The trichomes, which contain the cannabinoids and terpenes, are removed from the plant during this stage.

Next, the removed trichomes are manually sifted to ensure all plant matter is removed. The trichomes are made into a full melt <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/shatter-and-resin/">bubble hash</a>, which is put into a freeze drier.

The producer creates live rosin from the dried bubble hash by pressing it through a rosin press.

The finished live rosin is a high-quality product that ranges from creamy to yellowish in colour with a full terpene profile, rich scent, and robust flavour.
<h3>What Are the Differences Between Live Resin and Live Rosin?</h3>
The resulting live concentrates are both potent and high quality.

They differ primarily in how they are processed. This difference between live resin and live rosin matters to consumers who buy marijuana online.

Live resin is extracted using the BHO method, which uses a chemical solvent. With a solvent, there is always a chance that toxic residue—in this case, butane—will remain in the finished product.

Live rosin, however, uses a solventless method, so there is no chance of finding any chemical solvent in the finished product. For that reason, live rosin is an excellent option for the more wellness-focused cannabis consumer.
<h3>Why Buy Live Concentrates Online in Canada?</h3>
There are some key differences between live and cured concentrates and differences between live resin and live rosin. While it's not possible to smell a product you are viewing on a screen, there are some excellent benefits from choosing live concentrates.

The flavour and aroma of a full terpene profile both provide a well-rounded, enjoyable experience. With live concentrates, you need to be willing to pay a little extra. Live concentrates cost a bit more, and they are worth it! Think of them as a long-lasting treat because a little concentrate goes a long way.
<h2>What Are the Differences Between Live Resin and Live Rosin?</h2>
Overall, both of these live concentrates are potent and high quality. They are different products that are processed differently. Live rosin is considered healthier because it is a solventless concentrate, whereas live resin is a solvent-based concentrate.

Both offer a full "entourage effect" experience, and those who buy concentrates online in Canada will each have their own set of criteria when choosing what works best for them.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are you, or someone you know, have already experienced <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/cbd/">CBD oil benefits</a>. You may already have some in your medicine cabinet. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are new to the world of CBD tinctures, where do you begin? You probably have many questions about the basics and the best way to dose. Follow along on this quick introduction to all aspects of CBD tinctures.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is CBD Tincture?</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, what is a tincture? Tinctures have been around since 1000 AD. They have been used orally as medicine for thousands of years—elderberry tinctures, turmeric, echinacea, and cannabis tinctures are just some of many. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alcohol-based tinctures are common, but there are a few other ways to make them as well. Common carrier oils for CBD include MCT oil, avocado oil, and coconut oil. CBD tinctures come in small bottles with various concentrations. With the dose dropper, they are easy to dose and avoid risks associated with smoking. Allowed to absorb under the tongue, these tinctures take effect quickly.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the many </span><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product/mikro-honey-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD oil benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can expect? Canadians report relief from </span><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/cbd-oil-for-migraine-treatment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">migraines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/does-cbd-oil-stop-panic-attacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anxiety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sleep disorders, psoriasis, arthritis, eating disorders, and more. CBD is taking over the cannabis industry, creating some amazing stuff and wowing people with its groundbreaking properties. It is now common to be able to buy CBD online in Canada as well. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Properly Dose CBD </span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Figuring out your dose with CBD hemp oil is important but can also be overwhelming. There are so many tinctures, with so many numbers on their labels. Some tinctures range from 100mg to as high as 2000mg. No matter what bottle you have on hand, you'll need to figure out your personal dose.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The great thing about CBD is that it's safe and well-tolerated, even in high doses used within research studies. Remember, this is not THC, and you won't feel high or any of the other common side effects from THC-rich cannabis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, getting to know your personal dose is nevertheless important. CBD oil is mellow, but you don't want to waste any product. </span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start with 5 to 10 drops from your CBD tincture dose dropper before bed.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain the baseline dose for three to four days.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you experience no CBD oil benefits, increase the dose by 50 percent (10 to 20 drops).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain the new dose for three to four days.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repeat until you feel the positive effects.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If at any point you experience adverse side effects, like sleepiness or diarrhea, reduce the dose. You may also wish to split into smaller doses during the day.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does CBD Have Side Effects? </span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because CBD is a non-psychoactive cannabis compound, you will not feel stoned while consuming it. It is safe, but taking large amounts of CBD will make you feel a little sluggish. Some people also report diarrhea with large doses. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.who.int/medicines/access/controlled-substances/CannabidiolCriticalReview.pdf" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">World Health Organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has declared, "CBD is generally well tolerated with a good safety profile." But, as per their assessment, "reported adverse effects may be as a result of drug-drug interactions between CBD and patients' existing medications."</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you currently take prescription medications and are experiencing some of the mild effects of CBD, you may wish to consult your doctor. </span>

<b>Have You Experienced CBD Oil Benefits?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Canadians across the country, old and young alike, are exploring CBD oil benefits for a range of conditions. Everyone, even parents and grandparents, is curious about what this non-intoxicating cannabinoid can do. From sleep to mood to inflammation, this little cannabidiol has a big future in over-the-counter relief.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cannabis is everywhere, and it's hard to ignore given its status as one of the most widely used substances within Canada. Nearly half of Canadians reported having used marijuana at some point in their lives!

With the ability to buy recreational weed online, many Canadians are incorporating marijuana into their lifestyles. Given its popularity, those new to the marijuana scene and existing cannabis connoisseurs may be interested in growing their knowledge of the substance.
<h3>History of Weed in Canada</h3>
Canadians have been using cannabis for decades, though only legally since 2018. Canada was the second country in the world to legalize its possession and non-medical use. For much of the past century, the use of marijuana was considered a criminal offense <u><a href="https://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/legal-history-and-cultural-experience-cannabis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">under the law in Canada</a></u>.

Since its legalization, cannabis has become increasingly popular. This popularity is partially credited to the growing accessibility of weed, as buying recreational weed online is easy in Canada. The increase of reputable information on the effects of marijuana and its benefits has also encouraged more Canadians to incorporate cannabis into their lifestyles.
<h3>The Effects of Marijuana</h3>
Depending on the method of consumption, cannabis offers a variety of effects on the user. Overall, the <u><a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/marijuana-use-and-its-effects#1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">psychoactive ingredient</a></u> in weed (called THC) stimulates the area of the brain that responds to pleasure. As a result, dopamine is released, which gives the user a relaxed and even euphoric experience. Many experience an increased appetite.

Smoking weed delivers the quickest effects. When you smoke and inhale marijuana into the lungs, the drug quickly releases into the bloodstream, giving you the feeling of being high. It will take longer to feel the effects from other consumption methods like eating weed-infused edibles or drinking infused beverages.
<h3>Medical Benefits of Weed</h3>
The list of medical benefits to cannabis is ever-growing, as research in this area is continually evolving since its legalization in Canada. The most common use of marijuana for medicinal purposes is for pain control. While it may not be strong enough to manage severe pain cases, it can be an effective treatment option for those who experience chronic pain. For many, this is an attractive alternative to conventional pharmaceuticals that come with a long list of potentially harmful side effects.

There is also substantial evidence that marijuana can effectively <u><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165951/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">treat symptoms of nausea</a></u>. Many patients who endure chemotherapy rounds use cannabis to help alleviate nausea and vomiting caused by the treatments.
<h3>The Side Effects of Weed</h3>
As with any recreational or medical drug, there are potential side effects that come with the use of cannabis. While most marijuana users have an overall positive experience, some may experience unwanted effects such as anxiety or paranoia. Those new to consuming cannabis can help manage these symptoms by starting with a lower dose and working towards an enjoyable and comfortable experience.
<h2>Buy Recreational Weed Online in Canada</h2>
Purchasing weed is as simple as adding something to your online shopping cart. With reputable online dispensaries, you can choose cannabis products for smoking, vaping, or eating that are appealing to you and offer your desired experience. Browsing an <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com">online dispensary</a></u> for marijuana and <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/edibles/">weed-infused edibles</a> is a great way to research products and be informed before buying.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cannabis concentrates are all the rage, but with so many types available, how do you know where to start? If you'd like to buy concentrates online in Canada, then here we discuss the different extraction methods available.
<h2>Butane Honey Oil (BHO) Extractions</h2>
BHO extractions were originally used in the food and perfume industries. When used in the cannabis industry, <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/all-time-best-selling-weed-strains/">raw cannabis flower</a></u> is packed into a tube before butane is introduced in a pressurized environment to perform the extraction.

When the initial extraction is performed, the resulting cannabinoid-rich solution must be left so as the residual solvent can evaporate to safe levels. Many producers use a vacuum oven to purge the butane further and meet the regulatory requirements.

One drawback of BHO extraction is that it can be dangerous, so it is always best left to trained experts due to its flammable nature.

BHO extractions are most commonly used in the production of concentrates like shatter, crumble, budder, wax, and sap. With their high capacity for preserving cannabinoid content, BHO extraction techniques often average at around 80% <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/how-long-does-thc-stay-in-your-urine/">THC</a></u>.
<h2>CO2 Oil Extraction</h2>
CO2 extraction is widely used in the cannabis industry. It is both non-toxic and environmentally friendly.

It involves passing supercritical CO2 through raw cannabis buds to strip the trichomes from the plant. A liquid is then passed through a separator to remove the CO2 gas from the extracted material.

CO2 extraction is particularly effective at preserving terpene content in cannabis flower and, as a result, is especially beneficial when making waxes and oils.

An additional advantage is that it’s environmentally friendly. The CO2 gas used in extractions is pushed through a condenser, meaning the gas can liquify again before being recycled for reuse in other extractions.
<h2>Ethanol Extraction</h2>
Ethanol is widely used as a food preservative and is considered by the FDA to be safe for use. To extract THC from the cannabis plant, the raw plant material is soaked in a bath of ethanol.

The resulting solution is then refined further, where unwanted compounds are removed. It's this step that helps ensure that concentrates made from ethanol extractions are some of the purest and best-tasting available.
<h2>Solventless Extractions</h2>
While there are many high-tech extraction techniques available, it's also worth mentioning that some age-old methods exist that don't require the use of solvents at all. Many of these solventless techniques have existed for centuries, and they often preserve much of the valuable cannabinoid, <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/cannabis-terpenes-how-do-they-work-and-effects/">terpene</a></u>, and flavonoid content of the original plant material.

Whether it's hashish, charas, bubble hash, or <u><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/whats-the-difference-between-live-resin-live-rosin/">rosin</a></u>, these solventless concentrates require minimal specialized equipment. With some manual labour, along with heat and pressure, it's possible to create some of the cleanest and strongest concentrates on the market that preserve the entire plant profile of compounds.
<h2>Get Ready to Buy Concentrates Online in Canada</h2>
Whether produced from BHO, ethanol, CO2, or your very own manual labour as you press the resin out by hand, there are countless ways to make cannabis concentrates.

If you love concentrates, then it's important to know that each has its own advantages and disadvantages. With so many solvents used in the production of cannabis concentrates, it's important to remember to always buy them from a reputable source.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The growing popularity of marijuana in Canada has meant an expanding selection of products to choose from. Checking out a dispensary can be overwhelming even for experienced marijuana users, given the myriad products that line the shelves! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With cannabis shatter and wax for sale online, many are interested in the benefits of concentrates and dabbing in general. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But many are unsure of which concentrate best suits their needs. Read on to learn about the differences between shatter and wax so you feel like an expert at your next dispensary visit.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Shatter?</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Shatter is a type of cannabis concentrate used when dabbing (the act of inhaling cannabis concentrate vapour produced by a small water pipe). It is produced by processing plant materials with a solvent, creating a glass-like </span><a href="https://weedmaps.com/learn/dictionary/shatter/" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabis extract</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://weedmaps.com/learn/products-and-how-to-consume/how-shatter-is-made" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">texture can vary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from extremely brittle to a more pliable consistency. Its appearance is typically translucent but contains yellow-scale colouring ranging from light amber to a darker yellow shade like olive oil.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dabbers love shatter for its ease of use and potency. It goes through an </span><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-shatter-weed-and_b_8924396"><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional filtration process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to remove impurities and naturally occurring fats and waxes, making it an exceptionally pure concentrate that delivers an intense high. The extra filtration also removes marijuana’s famous dank smell and flavour, so your next dabbing session can be easy and discreet.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Wax?</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to shatter, marijuana wax is a form of cannabis concentrate that is used when dabbing. It is </span><a href="https://weedmaps.com/learn/dictionary/wax/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">produced by</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> packing marijuana buds into tubes, then flooding them with a solvent that separates the resin from the raw plant material. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The resin then goes through additional heating, condensation, and </span><a href="https://www.zamnesia.com/blog-bho-science-why-you-should-be-vacuum-purging-how-to-do-it-n488" rel="no follow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vacuum purging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which helps boil away the impurities and solvents involved in the production process). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After processing, we are left with the desirable and active part of the substance that can deliver a pure and potent experience when dabbed. The </span><a href="https://weedmaps.com/learn/products-and-how-to-consume/how-to-smoke-wax"><span style="font-weight: 400;">final product</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a waxy material that has an opaque appearance but a malleable texture. In terms of <a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/product-category/concentrates/">cannabis concentrates</a>, wax finds a middle ground between the solid brittle texture of shatter and hash oil’s liquid consistency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like shatter, marijuana wax has very little smell, making it a discreet alternative to the traditional method of smoking raw cannabis bud. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is Better?</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, there are many benefits to dabbing with shatter and wax, but does one reign supreme as a cannabis concentrate? Not really. It mostly comes down to personal preference, as both concentrates offer a powerful and long-lasting high when dabbed. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for something easy to handle and measure, wax might be the better option due to its malleable consistency. If you’re looking for a super long-lasting concentrate, shatter might be the better choice, as wax tends to degrade faster.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabis Shatter for Sale</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://wordpress-564151-1928835.cloudwaysapps.com/shop/">Online dispensaries</a> are accessible places to find a cannabis concentrate that is right for you. Buying shatter and wax online is the easiest way to research new products and find a product to help you achieve your desired high.</span>]]></content:encoded>
